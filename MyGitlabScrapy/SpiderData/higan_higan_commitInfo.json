I also emulate the CRC16 error check bit now.\nI added a really simple emulation of the Famicom controller port 2 microphone,\nwhere I just send random noise to the port when a Famicom/Microphone hotkey is\nheld down. Proper emulation would require ruby to support microphones. Next,\nMolive wrote an SNES PPU test surrounding sprites and force blank, which showed\nthat a) sprite evaluations happen during Hblank instead of during active display\n(which means the double-buffering system for OAM items/tiles can be eliminated),\nand b) when force blank is enabled, it just skips updating the buffer entirely\n(which is really strange ... I would've expected it'd zero out the sprites and\nshow nothing). So I emulate that test correctly now, but ... as always, exact\nPPU timings are unknown so this is just playing whack-a-mole, but at least\nit's more correct now than it was before.

So when\nyou start the program, I don't initialize any drivers, because sucky vendor\ndrivers can crash higan and you get stuck in a crash loop. So instead, you\nhave to \"activate\" the driver before the driver settings are editable. For\ninstance, until XAudio2 is initialized, it can't query XAudio2 for all available\nplayback devices. So you go to audio settings, activate your driver, and now\nyou can change devices. whenever you change any driver setting, it updates all\ndriver settings again and refreshes the entire settings panel again. Because\nfor instance, if you change a WASAPI device, the new device may not support the\ncurrently assigned frequency. Aren't computers fun?\n\nStarting a system initializes the input and audio drivers, so that\nauto-activates those drivers and you can immediately edit their settings. Video\nis more difficult ... you have to have a visible window that has been realized\non the screen before you can initialize a video driver. So to get it to auto\nactivate, you have to actually power on the system. Otherwise, when you hit\nactivate, I flash a 1x1 pixel viewport at the bottom left of the video settings\npanel, populate the settings, and then destroy it.\n\nThe downside to all of this is input ... if you try and bind hotkeys immediately\nafter starting higan, then no input driver will be bound. So, yeah, I gotta\nfigure out what I'm going to do there.\n\nLike bsnes v107, higan now lets you change drivers on the fly, but of course\nthat's risky, so ... you know. you probably shouldn't. \"activate\" becomes\n\"change\" once a driver is activated for the first time."], "commit_time": ["2019-03-03T08:49:08Z"]},

I wanted a design where the core runs alongside\ncreating new nodes, and copying in node values from a parallel tree next\nto it. With every step along the way, the true tree should have the\nequivalent level from the unserialized tree, so we can copy in exactly\nwhat we want, and ignore what we don't want. Anything less than this,\nand we're going to risk stagnant elements from previous versions\nsticking around in new trees and causing issues. Further, this redesign\nallows me to merge the peripheral node setup and device node binding\ntogether.\n\nIt required a huge amount of rewriting, but the idea works. So far only\nthe SNES cartridge and controller port gamepads work. And even then,\nthey just barely work. Lots of annoying issues like losing input\nmappings when unloading and reloading the gamepad, not displaying the\nfolder names in the system tree view, etc.\n\nI wanted to get further along, but I'm getting too tired to think, so\nit's best to stop here. It looks like I'll get one more day at this\ntomorrow due to it being some kind of Japanese holiday.

I did not yet rename node.bml to\nsettings.bml, nor did I merge manifest.bml to metadata.bml.\n\nI added a setting editor, which is fairly fancy. It'll show you the\nlatched value on static settings (eg CPU version#, which can't change\ndynamically), and in the tree it'll show you \"name: currentValue\n(latchedValue)\". Powering the system on latches the current settings,\nand refreshes the tree (but not yet the Latched: value in the setting\neditor ... polish work is needed.)\n\nThe node manager can refresh without losing its place now, which means\nyou can connect/disconnect peripherals without the port connector\ndisappearing.\n\nI ported the Master System (and its five systems) and the Game Boy\nAdvance to the new Node API. I also separated out the Game Boy Advance\ncore into two models: Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Player, since\nthey're different physical devices. I skipped over the Game Gear Up+Down\n/ Left+Right improved handling, so I'll need to get back to that.\n\nI created Video::Screen, which acts a lot like Audio::Stream insofar as\nallowing you to have different screens with different color counts and\ncolor conversion functions. The big use case for multiple screens will\nprobably be if we emulate a peripheral that has its own screen (think\nDreamcast VMU but something more modest ... maybe one of those weird\nperipherals Shonumi has been researching has a little status LCD screen\nor something.)\n\nI still need to update Audio::Stream to take a Node::Audio object on\nconstruction.\n\nI hooked up really, really rough save state support via a new tools\nmenu. Now, unfortunately I am so far unable to reproduce Tala's crashing\nbehavior with the Master System core's save states. If I can find a\nreproducable case, I'll fix it.\n\nSo at this point we have three of nine cores converted. Once they are\nall converted, I need to split off ColecoVision and SG-1000+SC-3000 to\ntheir own separate cores. That's still going to be a ton of extra code\nto write and compile, but the overall workload should be lessened with\nthe new higan/component/(video,audio) abstraction layer."], "commit_time": ["2019-02-14T03:25:06Z"]},

All of blargg's test ROMs that pass\nin gambatte now either pass in higan, or are off by 1-2 clocks (the\nactual behaviors are fully emulated.) I consider the Game Boy core to\nnow be fairly accurate, but there's still more improvements to be had.\n\nAlso, what's sure to be a major feature for some: higan now has full\nsupport for loading and playing ordinary ROM files, whether they have\ncopier headers, weird extensions, or are inside compressed archives. You\ncan load these games from the command-line, from the main Library menu\n(via Load ROM Image), or via drag-and-drop on the main higan window. Of\ncourse, fans of game folders and the library need not worry: that's\nstill there as well.\n\nAlso new, you can drop the (uncompressed) Game Boy Advance BIOS onto the\nhigan main window to install it into the correct location with the\ncorrect file name.\n\nLastly, this release technically restores Mac OS X support. However,\nit's still not very stable, so I have decided against releasing binaries\nat this time. I'd rather not rush this and leave a bad first impression\nfor OS X users.\n\nChangelog (since v096):\n- higan: project source code hierarchy restructured; icarus directly\n  integrated\n- higan: added software emulation of color-bleed, LCD-refresh,\n  scanlines, interlacing\n- icarus: you can now load and import ROM files/archives from the main\n  higan menu\n- NES: fixed manifest parsing for board mirroring and VRC pinouts\n- SNES: fixed manifest for Star Ocean\n- SNES: fixed manifest for Rockman X2,X3\n- GB: enabling LCD restarts frame\n- GB: emulated extra OAM STAT IRQ quirk required for GBVideoPlayer\n  (Shonumi)\n- GB: VBK, BGPI, OBPI are readable\n- GB: OAM DMA happens inside PPU core instead of CPU core\n- GB: fixed APU length and sweep operations\n- GB: emulated wave RAM quirks when accessing while channel is enabled\n- GB: improved timings of several CPU opcodes (gekkio)\n- GB: improved timings of OAM DMA refresh (gekkio)\n- GB: CPU uses open collector logic; return 0xFF for unmapped memory\n  (gekkio)\n- GBA: fixed sequencer enable flags; fixes audio in Zelda - Minish Cap\n  (Jonas Quinn)\n- GBA: fixed disassembler masking error (Lioncash)\n- hiro: Cocoa support added; higan can now be compiled on Mac OS X 10.7+\n- nall: improved program path detection on Windows\n- higan/Windows: moved configuration data from %appdata% to\n  %localappdata%\n- higan/Linux,BSD: moved configuration data from ~/.config/higan to\n  ~/.local/higan"], "commit_time": ["2016-01-17T08:59:25Z"]},

Instead, we set dma.pending flag when we\n  want a transfer (fixes GBA Video - Pokemon audio) [Cydrak]\n- fixed OBJ Vmosaic [Cydrak, krom]\n- OBJ cannot read <=0x13fff in BG modes 3-5 (fixes the garbled tile at\n  the top-left of some games)\n- DMA timing should be much closer to hardware now, but probably not\n  perfect\n- PPU frame blending uses blargg's bit-perfect, rounded method (slower,\n  but what can you do?)\n- GBA carts really unload now\n- added nall/gba/cartridge.hpp: used when there is no manifest. Scans\n  ROMs for library tags, and selects the first valid one found\n- added EEPROM auto-detection when EEPROM size=0. Forces disk/save state\n  size to 8192 (otherwise states could crash between pre and post\n  detect.)\n    - detects first read after a set read address command when the size\n      is zero, and sets all subsequent bit-lengths to that value, prints\n      detected size to terminal\n- added nall/nes/cartridge.hpp: moves iNES detection out of emulation\n  core.\n\nImportant to note: long-term goal is to remove all\nnall/(system)/cartridge.hpp detections from the core and replace with\ndatabases. All in good time.\nAnyway, the GBA workarounds should work for ~98.5% of the library, if my\npre-scanning was correct (~40 games with odd tags. I reject ones without\nnumeric versions now, too.)\n\nI think we're basically at a point where we can release a new version\nnow. Compatibility should be relatively high (at least for a first\nrelease), and fixes are only going to affect one or two games at a time.\nI'd like to start doing some major cleaning house internally (rename\nNES->Famicom, SNES->SuperFamicom and such.) Would be much wiser to do\nthat on a .01 WIP to minimize regressions.\n\nThe main problems with a release now:\n- speed is pretty bad, haven't really optimized much yet (not sure how\n  much we can improve it yet, this usually isn't easy)\n- sound isn't -great-, but the GBA audio sucks anyway :P\n- couple of known bugs (Sonic X video, etc.)"], "commit_time": ["2012-04-22T10:49:19Z"]},

The Enable\nOverscan option blanks out borders around the screen. This eliminates\nthe need for an overscan software filter. For NES, it's 16px from the\ntop and bottom, and 8px from the left and right. Anything less and you\nget scrolling artifacts in countless games. For the SNES, it's only 16px\nfrom the top and bottom. Main point is that most NTSC SNES games are\n224-height games, so you'll have black borders. Oh well, hack the source\nif you want. Game Boy overscan option does nothing.\n\nEverything except for the cheats.xml file now uses BML markup. I need to\nwrite a converter for cheats.xml still. Cut the SNES board parsing code\nin half, 30KB->16KB. Much cleaner now.\nTook the opportunity to fix a mistake I made back with the XML spec: all\nnumbers are integers, but can be prefixed with 0x to become hexadecimal.\nBefore, offset/size values defaulted to hex-mode even without a prefix,\nunlike frequency/etc values.\n\nThe XML shaders have gone in their own direction anyway, with most being\nmulti-pass and incompatible with bsnes. So that said, please don't\nextend the BML functionality from your end. But f eel free to add to the\nXML spec, since other emulators now use that as well. And don't\nmisunderstand, I love the work that's being done there. It's pretty\nawesome to see multi-pass shader capabilities, and the RAM watching\nstuff is just amazing.\nIf there are any really awesome single-pass shaders that people would\nlike, I can convert it from XML and include it with future releases.\nOn that topic, I removed the watercolor/hdr-tv ones from the binary\npackages (still in the source archive) ... they are neat, but not very\nuseful for actual gaming.\nIf we had more than one, I'd remove the Direct3D sepia one. Not going to\nuse shaders from a certain bipolar manic, because I'd never hear the end\nof it if I did :/\n\nOh, one change I think people will like: MSU1 no longer requires\na memory map specification, so MSU1 authors won't have to keep updating\nto my newer revisions of board markups. Basically, if there's not\na board with an msu1 section, it'll check if \"gamename.msu\" exists. If\nit does, MSU1 gets mapped to 00-3f,80-bf:2000-2007.

"commit_description": ["\nbyuu says:\n\nRewrote the way menus are attached, they act like layouts/widgets now.\n\nAll three phoenix targets once again work with both radio menu items and\nradio widgets. Both GTK+ and Qt have built-in group controls right\ninside the widgets, so I don't have to keep my own groups around\nanymore. They do act screwy at widget creation though, have to jump\nthrough some hoops to get it to work right. All I can say is, definitely\nset all child widgets to the parent before trying to check any of them.\n\nMy long-term goal for the main window is to honor the fullscreen video\nsetting as a generic setting, and let the window scale auto-fit the best\npossible size that matches your scale preference into the output window,\ncentered just like fullscreen. For now, I've just set it to a fixed\nwindow size until I finish working on phoenix. The scale X settings will\njust be to snap the window to an exact size in case you don't want any\nblack borders, they won't be radio items and the bsnes-geometry.cfg file\nwill save width/height information as well.\n\nSimplified the sizing requirements for creating layouts and updated all\nbsnes windows to support the new system. Layouts also expose their\nminimum width/height values, which I use to create perfectly sized\nwindows on all three platforms. This will fix cut-off heights on the\nlast Windows WIP.

Since\nhigan lets you map multiple physical inputs to one emulated input, you\ncan now configure your keyboard and multiple gamepads to the same\nemulated input, and then just use whatever controller you want.\n\nBecause USB gamepad makers failed to provide unique serial#s with each\ncontroller, we have to limit the mapping to specific USB ports.\nOtherwise, we couldn't distinguish two otherwise identical gamepads. So\nbasically your computer USB ports act like real game console input port\nnumbers. Which is kind of neat, I guess.\n\nAnd the really nice thing about the new system is that we now have the\ncapability to support hotplugging input devices. I haven't yet added\nthis to any drivers, but I'm definitely going to add it to udev for v094\nofficial.\n\nFinally, with the device ID (vendor ID + product ID) exposed, we gain\none last really cool feature that we may be able to develop more in the\nfuture. Say we created a joypad.bml file to include with higan. In it,\nwe'd store the Xbox 360 controller, and pre-defined button mappings for\neach emulated system. So if higan detects you have an Xbox 360\ncontroller, you can just plug it in and use it. Even better, we can\nclearly specify the difference between triggers and analog axes, and\nname each individual input. So you'd see \"Xbox 360 Gamepad #1: Left\nTrigger\" instead of higan v093's \"JP0::Axis2.Hi\"\n\nNote: for right now, ethos' input manager isn't filtering the device IDs\nto look pretty. So you're going to see a 64-bit hex value for a device\nID right now instead of something like Joypad#N for now."], "commit_time": ["2013-12-23T11:43:51Z"]},

Not sure what I was thinking. The BRR buffer was 12-bytes, and\nhas very weird behavior ... but there's only a single location in the\ncode where it actually writes to this buffer. It's much easier to just\nwrite to the buffer three times there instead of implementing an entire\nclass just to abstract away two lines of code. This change actually\nboosted the speed from ~124.5fps to around ~127.5fps, but that's within\nthe margin of error for GCC. I doubt it's actually faster this way.\n\nThe DSP core could really use a ton of work. It comes from a port of\nblargg's spc_dsp to my coding style, but he was extremely fond of using\n32-bit signed integers everywhere. There's a lot of opportunity to\nremove red tape masking by resizing the variables to their actual state\nsizes.\n\nI really need to find where I put spc_dsp6.sfc from blargg. It's a great\ntest to verify if I've made any mistakes in my implementation that would\ncause regressions. Don't suppose anyone has it?\n\n[2] so again, the idea is that higan/audio and higan/video are going to\nsit between the emulation cores and the user interfaces. The hope is to\noutput raw encoding data from the emulation cores without having to\nworry about the video display format (generally 24-bit RGB) of the host\ndisplay. And also to avoid having to repeat myself with eg three\nseparate implementations of interframe blending, and so on.\n\nFurthermore, the idea is that the user interface can configure its side\nof the settings, and the emulation cores can configure their sides.\nThus, neither has to worry about the other end. And now we can spin off\nnew user interfaces much easier without having to mess with all of these\nthings.\n\nRight now, I've implemented color emulation, interframe blending and\nSNES horizontal color bleed. I did not implement scanlines (and\ninterlace effects for them) yet, but I probably will at some point.\n\nFurther, for right now, the WonderSwan/Color screen rotation is busted\nand will only show games in the horizontal orientation. Obviously this\nmust be fixed before the next official release, but I'll want to think\nabout how to implement it.\n\nAlso, the SNES light gun pointers are missing for now.\n\nThings are a bit messy right now as I've gone through several revisions\nof how to handle these things, so a good house cleaning is in order once\neverything is feature-complete again. I need to sit down and think\nthrough how and where I want to handle things like light gun cursors,\nLCD icons, and maybe even rasterized text messages.\n\nAnd obviously ... higan/audio is still just nall::DSP's headers. I need\nto revamp that whole interface. I want to make it quite powerful with\na true audio mixer so I can handle things like\nSNES+SGB+MSU1+Voicer-Kun+SNES-CD (five separate audio streams at once.)\n\nThe video system has the concept of \"effects\" for things like color\nbleed and interframe blending. I want to extend on this with useful\nother effects, such as NTSC simulation, maybe bringing back my mini-HQ2x\nfilter, etc. I'd also like to restore the saturation/gamma/luma\nadjustment sliders ... I always liked allowing people to compensate for\ntheir displays without having to change settings system-wide. Lastly,\nI've always wanted to see some audio effects. Although I doubt we'll\never get my dream of CoreAudio-style profiles, I'd like to get some\nbasic equalizer settings and echo/reverb effects in there."], "commit_time": ["2016-04-11T21:29:56Z"]},

It's still possible, so I'll sacrifice a little\ncomplexity for a rare case to make it a lot easier for the more common\ncase.  ST cartridges currently won't let you load the secondary slot.\nBS-X Town cart is the only useful game to load with nothing in the slot,\nbut only barely, since games are all seeded on flash and not on PSRAM\nimages. We can revisit a way to boot the BIOS directly if and when we\nget the satellite uplink emulated and data can be downloaded onto the\nPSRAM :P BS-X slotted cartridges still require the secondary slot.\n\nMy plan for BS-X slotted cartridges is to require a manifest.xml to\nspecify that it has the BS-X slot present.  Otherwise, we have to load\nthe ROM into the SNES cartridge class, and parse its header before we\ncan find out if it has one. Screw that.  If it's in the XML, I can tell\nbefore loading the ROM if I need to present you with an optional slot\nloading dialog.  I will probably do something similar for Sufami Turbo.\nNot all games even work with a secondary slot, so why ask you to load\na second slot for them? Let the XML request a second slot. A complete\nSufami Turbo ROM set will be trivial anyway.  Not sure how I want to do\nthe sub dialog yet. We want basic file loading, but we don't want it to\nlook like the dialog 'didn't do anything' if it pops back open\nimmediately again.

Of course, some of them aren't 100% completed\nyet, either. Lots of craziness with MOVEM, and BCC has a BSR variant\nthat needs stack push/pop functions.\n\nThis WIP actually took over eight hours to make, going through every\npossible permutation on how to design the core itself. The updated design\nnow builds both the instruction decoder+dispatcher and the disassembler\ndecoder into the same main loop during M68K's constructor.\n\nThe special cases are also really psychotic on this processor, and\nI'm afraid of missing something via the fallthrough cases. So instead,\nI'm ordering the instructions alphabetically, and including exclusion\ncases to ignore binding invalid cases. If I end up remapping an existing\nregister, then it'll throw a run-time assertion at program startup.\n\nI wanted very much to get rid of struct EA (EffectiveAddress), but\nit's too difficult to keep track of the internal effective address\nwithout it. So I split out the size to a separate parameter, since\nevery opcode only has one size parameter, and otherwise it was getting\nduplicated in opcodes that take two EAs, and was also awkward with the\nflag testing. It's a bit more typing, but I feel it's more clean this way.\n\nOverall, I'm really worried this is going to be too slow. I don't want\nto turn the EA stuff into templates, because that will massively bloat\nout compilation times and object sizes, and will also need a special DSL\npreprocessor since C++ doesn't have a static for loop. I can definitely\noptimize a lot of EA's address/read/write functions away once the core\nis completed, but it's never going to hold a candle to a templatized\n68K core.\n\n----\n\nForgot to include the SA-1 regression fix.

The map() function\nnow has an accompanying unmap() function, and instead of a fixed 256\ncallbacks, it'll scan to find the first available slot. unmap() will\nfree slots up when zero addresses reference a given slot.\n\nThe controllers and expansion port are now both entirely dynamic.\nInstead of load/unload/power/reset, they only have the constructor\n(power/reset/load) and destructor (unload). What this means is you can\nnow dynamically change even expansion port devices after the system is\nloaded.\n\nNote that this is incredibly dangerous and stupid, but ... oh well. The\nwhole point of this was for 21fx. There's no way to change the expansion\nport device prior to loading a game, but if the 21fx isn't active, then\nthe reset vector hijack won't work. Now you can load a 21fx game, change\nthe expansion port device, and simply reset the system to active the\ndevice.\n\nThe unification of design between controller port devices and expansion\nport devices is nice, and overall this results in a reduction of code\n(all of the Mapping stuff in Cartridge is gone, replaced with direct bus\nmapping.) And there's always the potential to expand this system more in\nthe future now.\n\nThe big missing feature right now is the ability to push/pop mappings.\nSo if you look at how the 21fx does the reset vector, you might vomit\na little bit. But ... it works.\n\nAlso changed exit(0) to _exit(0) in the POSIX version of nall::execute.\n\n[The _exit(0) thing is an attempt to make higan not crash when it tries\nto launch icarus and it's not on $PATH. The theory is that higan forks,\nthen the child tries to exec icarus and fails, so it exits, all the\nunique_ptrs clean up their resources and tell the X server to free\nthings the parent process is still using. Calling _exit() prevents\ndestructors from running, and seems to prevent the problem. -Ed.]"], "commit_time": ["2016-04-09T10:21:18Z"]},

For the Super Famicom, this\nperforms horizontal blending for proper pseudo-hires translucency. For\nthe Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance, this performs\ninterframe blending (each frame is the average of the current and\nprevious frame), which is important for things like the GBVideoPlayer.\n\n[2] Right now, this only applies to the Super Famicom, but it'll come to\nthe Famicom in the future. For the Super Famicom, this option doesn't\njust add scanlines, it simulates the phosphor decay that's visible in\ninterlace mode. If you observe an interlaced game like RPM Racing on\na real SNES, you'll notice that even on perfectly still screens, the\nimage appears to shake. This option emulates that effect.\n\nNote 1: the buffering right now is a little sub-optimal, so there will\nbe a slight speed hit with this new support. Since the core is now\ngenerating native ARGB8888 colors, it might as well call out to the\ninterface to lock/unlock/refresh the video, that way it can render\ndirectly to the screen. Although ... that might not be such a hot idea,\nsince the GBx interframe blending reads from the target buffer, and that\ntends to be a catastrophic option for performance.\n\nNote 2: the balanced and performance profiles for the SNES are\ncompletely busted again. This WIP took 6 1/2 hours, and I'm exhausted.\nVery much not looking forward to working on those, since those two have\nall kinds of fucked up speedup tricks for non-interlaced and/or\nnon-hires video modes.\n\nNote 3: if you're on Windows and you saved your system folders somewhere\nelse, now'd be a good time to move them to %localappdata%/higan"], "commit_time": ["2016-01-15T10:06:51Z"]},

There\nare some problems that need to be addressed:\n\n- Windows ComboBox height setting needs widget creation height to\n  properly scale itself (make Widget::setGeometry virtual and override\n  ComboBox::setGeometry)\n- Windows Canvas is completely broken\n- GTK+ Canvas is slow as shit compared to Qt Canvas, probably nothing\n  I can do about it, have to do a very costly conversion because GTK+ is\n  stupid and uses BGR like Nintendo\n- GTK+ listboxes are fucking insanely complicated to set up. Currently\n  I just split the second-half of creation to the setHeaderText call,\n  but when you don't call that, things explode\n  - I'm probably going to have to completely destroy and recreate\n    listboxes when changing the header text / column count\n- Qt resize code is still impossible to get right, it's not letting me\n  size a window > 2/3rds of the screen size (it's in their docs)\n  - I swear, Qt is the most painful API in the world to move/size\n    windows with\n- now that Window is separate, it really needs geometry() and\n  frameGeometry() as the two are quite different\n- I need a way to toggle window resizability for fixed layouts, Qt is\n  once again going to be a nightmare as it lacks a way to do this other\n  than fixed layouts\n- GTK+ currently explodes on bsnes, millions of console messages,\n  wonderful\n- plenty more I'm forgetting\n\nOne bit of really cool/good news though: I made\nFixed/Horizontal/Vertical layouts external to phoenix itself. The code\nis included for all targets so that it's always there and compiled into\none object, but the great news is that you can easily write your own\nlayout widgets and they'll work on all toolkits instantly.\n\nThat resize issue with bsnes was so simple it's annoying: my FixedLayout\ncontainer was repositioning on geometry updates. Made it only do it once\nat creation like it should.\n\nbsnes now has a fancy resize, grow the window and get black borders,\nshrink it and the video shrinks with it. I plan to make it fancier with\nconstraint settings (center, scale, stretch). Basically I want to turn\nthe fullscreen setting into a general setting that also applies to\nwindowed scaling. I will probably turn the video scale X sizes into\nregular items instead of radio boxes, so you can easily reset to a fixed\nsize whenever you want. Update bsnes to remember width,height geometry\nas well and it should be quite nice."], "commit_time": ["2011-02-07T09:18:01Z"]},

emulation. The Nintendo DS\nmodule was written entirely by Cydrak, so please give him all of the\ncredit for it. I for one am extremely grateful to be allowed to use his\nmodule in bsnes.\n\nThe Nintendo DS emulator's standalone name is dasShiny. You will need\nthe Nintendo DS firmware, which I cannot provide, in order to use it. It\nalso cannot (currently?) detect the save type used by NDS games. As\nsuch, manifest.xml files must be created manually for this purpose. The\nlong-term plan is to create a database of save types for each game.\nAlso, you will need an analog input device for the touch screen for now\n(joypad axes work well.)\n\nThere have also been a lot of changes from my end: a unified\nmanifest.xml format across all systems, major improvements to SPC7110\nemulation, enhancements to RTC emulation, MSU1 enhancements, icons in\nthe file browser list, improvements to SNES coprocessor memory mapping,\ncleanups and improvements in the libraries used to build bsnes, etc.\n\nI've also included kaijuu (which allows launching game folders directly\nwith bsnes) and purify (which allows opening images that are compressed,\nhave copier headers, and have wrong extensions); both of which are fully\nGUI-based.\n\nThis release only loads game folders, not files. Use purify to load ROM\nfiles in bsnes.\n\nNote that this will likely be the last release for a long time, and that\nI will probably rename the emulator for the next release, due to how\nmany additional systems it now supports."], "commit_time": ["2012-08-07T14:08:37Z"]},

The Game Boy Advance emulation is also\nnow substantially improved with vastly improved sound quality and a new\ndot-based PPU renderer. With that change, every single component in\nhigan is now cycle-based.

Real hardware would work by streaming the data\nbyte by byte. So with that, I went ahead and rewrote the code to handle\nbyte-based streaming.\n\nThis WIP is an important milestone for me personally. Up until now,\nbsnes has always had code that was directly copy-pasted from other\nauthors. With all of the DSP and Cx4 chips rewritten in LLE, and the\nSPC7110 algorithm already ported over from C, and archive decompression\ncode removed for a long time, the S-DD1 was the only module left like\nthis. It's obviously not that big of a deal. The code is basically still\na copy of the original. S-DD1 decomp from Andreas Naive, SPC7110 decomp\nfrom neviksti, and S-DSP from blargg. And the rest of the emulator is of\ncourse only possible because of code and research before it, although\neverything else has no resemblance at all to code before it. The main\nadvantage, really, is absolute code consistency. I always use the same\nvariant of K&R, for instance. I dunno, I guess I just never really liked\nthe \"Build-a-Bear Workshop\" style of emulators, like is so prominent in\nthe Genesis scene: \"My new Genesis emu (uses Starscream/Musashi 68K\ncore, Marat Fayzullin's Z80 core, YM2612 core from Game_Music_Emu, VDP\ncore from Gens, SVP core from picodrive)\", sorry, but you wrote\na front-end, not an emulator :/\n\nI also updated the SPC7110 decompression module: I merged the class\ninside the SPC7110 class (not sure why it was separate before), and\nreplaced the morton lookup tables with for-loops. The morton tables were\nadded to be a tiny bit faster when I was more interested in speed than\ncode clarity. It may be a tiny bit slower (or faster due to less L2\ncache usage), but you won't even notice an FPS drop, and it cuts out\na good chunk of code and some tables. Lastly, I added pinput_poll() to\nvideo_refresh(). Forgot to remove Interface::input_poll() from the C++\nside, will have to do that later."], "commit_time": ["2011-06-28T11:36:00Z"]},

Window is now a base type (inherits from Object,\nnot Widget), same for Layout. FixedLayout still inherits from Layout.\nAdded HorizontalLayout and VerticalLayout types, that can append each\nother to themselves to create box layouts. Layout margins are supported,\nspacing is specified inline (I find this a much better way to fine-grain\nspacing than Qt's single setSpacing function), and alignment is handled\nstrictly via padding widgets (insert a zero-sized label and it will\nautomatically grow to consume all extra space.)\n\nOverall, my box packing model is slightly less powerful than Qt's, but\nit is a good deal simpler and and easier to use in 90% of cases. The one\nlimitation I hit was with my input settings window, I'm not currently\nable to embed two different layouts and toggle one on and the other off\nto show only either { mouse x-axis, y-axis } or { mouse left, middle,\nright }, so they instead just space out differently and I had to grow\nthe input window width a bit to compensate.\n\nResizing works great, pretty cool seeing that this is the first time\nI've ever written my own resizer. I had to fight with Qt for several\nhours to the point of potentially developing an aneurysm, but I finally\ngot it to properly handle geometry and sizing stuff. Some weird issue\nwith the bsnes viewport widget, I tell it to resize and for some reason\nit doesn't. Cheap hack, I just make it constantly resize every video\nrefresh and it eventually takes. Wish I knew what was up with that.\n\nAll of bsnes now uses dynamic layouts sans the main window, so you can\nresize them however you like.\n\nThis is still all Qt-only, I'm afraid.

Mode7 repeat issue in the accuracy core.\n\nMore importantly, it's the first build to include phoenix. There is\na stub GUI that does basically nothing right now. It will give you\na window, a command to close the emulator, and an FPS meter so you can\ntell how fast it is. To load a ROM, you have to drag the ROM on top of\nthe binary. I don't know if it will work if the filename+path has spaces\nin it or not, so avoid that to be safe.\n\n[...]\n\nFor some reason, the 64-bit binary sometimes crashes on start, maybe 1:6\ntimes. So just keep trying. I don't know what's up with that, I'd\nappreciate if someone here wanted to debug that for me though :D\n\nOne really good bit of news, there was that old hiro bug where keyboard\ninput would cause the main window to beep. I spied on the main event\nloop and, as suspected, the status bar was getting focus and rejecting\nkey presses. What. The. Fuck. Why would a status bar ever need focus? So\nI set WM_DISABLED on it, which luckily leaves the font color alone.\nI also had to use WM_DISABLED on the Viewport widget that I use for\nvideo output. These two combined let me have my main window with no\nkeyboard beeping AND allow tab+shift-tab to work as you'd expect on\nother windows, so hooray.\n\nNow, at the moment there's no Manifest included, because Microsoft for\nsome reason includes the processorArcitecture in the file. So I can't\nuse the same manifest for 32-bit and 64-bit mode, or the binary will\ncrash on one or the other. Fuck. So the status bar may look old-school\nor something, whatever, it's only temporary.\n\nNext up, my goal is to avoid the hiro icon corruption bullshit by making\nphoenix itself try and use an internal resource icon. So just compile\nyour app with that resource icon and voila, perfect icon. Not in there\nyet so you get the white box.\n\nInput is hard-coded, up/down/left/right/z/x/a/s/d/c/apostrophe/return.\n\nLastly, compilation is ... in a serious state of flux. The code is set\nto compile bsnes/phoenix-gtk right now. Try it at your own risk. Give me\na few WIPs to get everything nice and refined. Ubuntu users will need\ngcc-4.5, which you can get by adding the Maverick Meerkat repository,\nupdating apt, installing the gcc-4.5 + g++-4.5 packages, and then\nremoving and re-updating your apt/sources.list file so you don't end up\nfucking your whole system when you run apt again in the future.\n\nFor anyone who can work with all of that, great! Please post a framerate\ncomparison between 32-bit and 64-bit builds. Any game, any screen, so\nlong as the FPS is not fluctuating when you measure it (eg don't do it\nduring an attract sequence.)\n\nIf anyone complains about the 64-bit binary not working and it turns out\nthey are on 32-bit Windows, they are going to be removed from this WIP\nforum :P"], "commit_time": ["2010-10-20T11:47:14Z"]},

I will add that in when I start dumping more cartridges here\nsoon.\n\nFinally ... I explained this already, but I'll do so here as well: I\nremoved icarus' support for loading SNES coprocessor firmware games with\nexternal firmware files (eg dsp1.program.rom + dsp1.data.rom in the same\npath as supermariokart.sfc, for example.)\n\nI realize most are going to see this as an antagonizing/stubborn move\ngiven the recent No-Intro discussion, and I won't deny that said thread\nis why this came to the forefront of my mind. But on my word, I honestly\nbelieve this was an ineffective solution for many reasons not related to\nour disagreements:\n\n 1. No-Intro distributes SNES coprocessor firmware as a merged file, eg\n    \"DSP1 (World).zip/DSP1 (World).bin\" -- icarus can't possibly know\n    about every ROM distribution set's naming conventions for firmware.\n    (Right now, it appears GoodSNES and NSRT are mostly dead; but there\n    may be more DATs in the future -- including my own.)\n 2. Even if the user obtains the firmware and tries to rename it, it\n    won't work: icarus parses manifests generated by the heuristics\n    module and sees two ROM files: dsp1.program.rom and dsp1.data.rom.\n    icarus cannot identify a file named dsp1.rom as containing both\n    of these sub-files. Users are going to have to know how to split\n    files, which there is no way to do on stock Windows. Merging files,\n    however, can be done via `copy /b supermariokart.sfc+dsp1.rom\n    supermariokartdsp.sfc`; - and dsp1.rom can be named whatever now.\n    I am not saying this will be easy for the average user, but it's\n    easier than splitting files.\n 3. Separate firmware breaks icarus' database lookup. If you have\n    pilotwings.sfc but without firmware, icarus will not find a match\n    for it in the database lookup phase. It will then fall back on\n    heuristics. The heuristics will pick DSP1B for compatibility with\n    Ballz 3D which requires it. And so it will try to pull in the\n    wrong firmware, and the game's intro will not work correctly.\n    Furthermore, the database information will be unavailable, resulting\n    in inaccurate mirroring.\n\nSo for these reasons, I have removed said support. You must now load\nSNES coprocessor games into higan in one of two ways: 1) game paks with\nsplit files; or 2) SFC images with merged firmware.\n\nIf and when No-Intro deploys a method I can actually use, I give you all\nmy word I will give it a fair shot and if it's reasonable, I'll support\nit in icarus."], "commit_time": ["2017-08-28T12:46:14Z"]},

is; doesn't have to be 48000hz\n- tomoko: removed the ability to change the frequency from the UI (but\n  it will display the frequency used)\n- tomoko: removed the timing settings panel\n  - the goal is to work toward smooth video via adaptive sync\n  - the model is broken by not being in control of the audio frequency\n    anyway\n  - it's further broken by PAL running at 50hz and WSC running at 75hz\n  - it was always broken anyway by SNES interlace timing varying from\n    progressive timing\n- higan: audio/ stub created (for now, it's just nall/dsp/ moved here\n  and included as a header)\n- higan: video/ stub created\n- higan/GNUmakefile: now includes build rules for essential components\n  (libco, emulator, audio, video)\n\nThe audio changes are in preparation to merge

perhaps not perfect, pretty good is better than nothing ... I've\nadded emulation of auto-joypad poll timing.\nGoing off ikari_01's confirmation of what we suspected, that the strobe\nhappens every 256 clocks, I've set up emulation as follows:\nUpon reset, our clock counter is reset to zero.\nAt the start of each frame, our poll counter is reset to zero.\nEvery 256 clocks, we call the step_auto_joypad_poll() function.\nIf we are at V=225/240+ (based on overscan setting), we check the poll\ncounter.\nAt zero, we poll the actual controller and set the joypad polling flag\nin $4212.d0 to 1.\nFrom zero through fifteen, we read in one bit for each controller and\nshift it into the register.\nAt sixteen, we turn off the joypad polling flag.\nThe 256-clock divider allows the start point of polling for each frame\nto fluctuate wildly like real hardware.\nI count regardless of auto joypad enable, as per $4212.d0's behavior;\nbut only poll when it's actually enabled.\nI do not consume any actual time from this polling. I honestly don't\nknow if I even should, or if it manages to do it in the background.\nIf it should consume time, then this most likely happens between opcode\nedges and we'll have to adjust the code a good bit.\n\nAll commercial games should continue to work fine, but this will likely\nbreak some hacks/translations not tested on hardware.\nWithout the timing emulation, reading $4218-421f before V=~228 would\nbasically give you the valid input controller values of the previous\nframe.\nNow, like hardware, it should give you a state that is part previous\nframe, part current frame shifted into it. Button positions won't be\nreliable and will shift every 256 clocks.\n\nI've also removed the Qt GUI, and renamed ui-phoenix to just ui. This\nremoves 400kb of source code (phoenix is a lean 130kb), and drops the\narchive size from 564KB to 475KB. Combined with the DSP HLE, and we've\nknocked off ~570KB of source cruft from the entire project.

["\nbyuu says:\n\nThis release marks a major step forward, offering full low-level\nemulation of all four DSP coprocessors based on the NEC uPD77C25\nprocessor core. Many people were responsible for this milestone: Dr.\nDecapitator for the actual decapping and extraction; Lord Nightmare for\nthe cartridges and some special analysis tools; myself, Jonas Quinn and\nCydrak for the uPD77C25 emulation; and all of the donors who raised the\nnecessary $1,000 for the necessary hardware and equipment needed to pull\nthis all off. To say thanks to the donors, I am releasing the uPD77C25\nemulation core to the public domain, so that everyone can benefit from\nit.\n\nAll four DSP emulations will be improved by this by way of having\nrealistic timing; the DSP-4 will benefit further as the high-level\nemulation was incomplete and somewhat buggy; and the DSP-3 will benefit\nthe most as the high-levle emulation there was not complete enough to be\nplayable. As a result, most notably, this means bsnes v073 is the first\nemulator to fully be able to play SD Gundam GX (J)!\n\nAs bsnes' primary goal is accuracy, the LLE DSP support renders the old\nHLE DSP support obsolete. Ergo, I have removed the 166KB of HLE source\ncode, and replaced it with the uPD77C25 core, which comprises a mere\n20KB of source code. As this LLE module supports save states, this also\nmeans that for the first time, DSP-3 and DSP-4 games have save state\nsupport.\n\nOn the other hand, this also means that to run any DSP game, you will\nneed the appropriate program ROM. As these are copyrighted, I cannot\ndistribute them nor tell you where to get them. All I can do is provide\nyou with the necessary filenames and hashes.\n\nChangelog (since v072 release):\n* added NEC uPD77C25 emulation core\n* added low-level emulation of the DSP-1, DSP-1B, DSP-2, DSP-3, DSP-4\n  coprocessors\n* removed high-level emulation of the DSP-n coprocessors\n* added blargg's libco::ppc.c module, which is far more portable, even\n  running on the PS3\n* added software filter support via binary plugins\n* added debugger (currently Linux-only); but it is as yet unstable\n* added pause shortcut\n* updated mightymo's cheat code database"], "commit_time": ["2010-12-26T12:24:34Z"]},

I'm really not a good person. I'm inherently selfish.\n\nMy responsibility and obligation right now is to work on loki, and\nthen on the Tengai Makyou Zero translation, and then on improving the\nFamicom emulation.\n\nAnd yet ... it's not what I really want to do. That shouldn't matter;\nI should work on my responsibilities first.\n\nInstead, I'm going to be a greedy, self-centered asshole, and work on\nwhat I really want to instead.\n\nI'm really sorry, guys. I'm sure this will make a few people happy,\nand probably upset even more people.\n\nI'm also making zero guarantees that this ever gets finished. As always,\nI wish I could keep these things secret, so if I fail / give up, I could\njust drop it with no shame. But I would have to cut everyone out of the\nWIP process completely to make it happen. So, here goes ...\n\nThis WIP adds the initial skeleton for Sega Mega Drive / Genesis\nemulation. God help us.\n\n(minor note: apparently the new extension for Mega Drive games is .md,\nneat. That's what I chose for the folders too. I thought it was .smd,\nso that'll be fixed in icarus for the next WIP.)\n\n(aside: this is why I wanted to get v100 out. I didn't want this code in\na skeleton state in v100's source. Nor did I want really broken emulation,\nwhich the first release is sure to be, tarring said release.)\n\n...\n\nSo, basically, I've been ruminating on the legacy I want to leave behind\nwith higan. 3D systems are just plain out. I'm never going to support\nthem. They're too complex for my abilities, and they would run too slowly\nwith my design style. I'm not willing to compromise my design ideals. And\nI would never want to play a 3D game system at native 240p/480i resolution\n... but 1080p+ upscaling is not accurate, so that's a conflict I want\nto avoid entirely. It's also never going to emulate computer systems\n(X68K, PC-98, FM-Towns, etc) because holy shit that would completely\ndestroy me. It's also never going emulate arcade machines.\n\nSo I think of higan as a collection of 2D emulators for consoles\nand handhelds. I've gone over every major 2D gaming system there is,\nlooking for ones with games I actually care about and enjoy. And I\nbasically have five of those systems supported already. Looking at the\nremaining list, I see only three systems left that I have any interest\nin whatsoever: PC-Engine, Master System, Mega Drive. Again, I'm not in\nany way committing to emulating any of these, but ... if I had all of\nthose in higan, I think I'd be content to really, truly, finally stop\nwriting more emulators for the rest of my life.\n\nAnd so I decided to tackle the most difficult system first. If I'm\nsuccessful, the Z80 core should cover a lot of the work on the SMS. And\nthe HuC6280 should land somewhere between the NES and SNES in terms of\ndifficulty ... closer to the NES.\n\nThe systems that just don't appeal to me at all, which I will never touch,\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n* Atari 2600/5200/7800\n* Lynx\n* Jaguar\n* Vectrex\n* Colecovision\n* Commodore 64\n* Neo-Geo\n* Neo-Geo Pocket / Color\n* Virtual Boy\n* Super A'can\n* 32X\n* CD-i\n* etc, etc, etc.\n\nAnd really, even if something were mildly interesting in there ... we\nhave to stop. I can't scale infinitely. I'm already way past my limit,\nbut I'm doing this anyway. Too many cores bloats everything and kills\nquality on everything. I don't want higan to become MESS v2.\n\nI don't know what I'll do about the Famicom Disk System, PC-Engine CD,\nand Mega CD. I don't think I'll be able to achieve 60fps emulating the\nMega CD, even if I tried to.\n\nI don't know what's going to happen here with even the Mega Drive. Maybe\nI'll get driven crazy with the documentation and quit. Maybe it'll end\nup being too complicated and I'll quit. Maybe the emulation will end up\nway too slow and I'll give up. Maybe it'll take me seven years to get\nany games playable at all. Maybe Steve Snake, AamirM and Mike Pavone\nwill pool money to hire a hitman to come after me. Who knows.\n\nBut this is what I want to do, so ... here goes nothing."], "commit_time": ["2016-07-09T04:21:37Z"]},

The main window also doesn't try\nso hard to constantly clear itself. This may leave a bit of unwelcome\nresidue behind in some video drivers during resize, but under most\ndrivers, it lets you resize without a huge amount of flickering.\n\nOn all platforms, I now also run the emulation during MessageWindow\nmodal events, where I didn't before.\n\nI'm thinking we should probably mute the audio during modal periods,\nsince it can generate a good deal of distortion.\n\nThe tooltip timeout was increased to ten seconds.\n\nOn Windows, the enter key can now activate buttons, so you can more\nquickly dismiss MessageDialog windows. This part may not actually work\n... I'm in the middle of trying to get messages out of the global\n`Application_windowProc` hook and into the individual `Widget_windowProc`\nhooks, so I need to do some testing.\n\nI fixed a bug where changing the input driver wouldn't immediately\nreload the input/hotkey settings lists properly.\n\nI also went from disabling the driver \"Change\" button when the currently\nactive driver is selected in the list, to instead setting it to say\n\"Reload\", and I also added a tool tip to the input driver reload button,\nadvising that if you're using DirectInput or SDL, you can hit \"Reload\"\nto rescan for hotplugged gamepads without needing to restart the\nemulator. XInput and udev have auto hotswap support. If we can ever get\nthat into DirectInput and SDL, then I'll remove the tooltip. But\nregardless, the reload functionality is nice to have for all drivers.\n\nI'm not sure what should happen when a user changes their driver\nselection while a game is loaded, gets the warning dialog, chooses not\nto change it, and then closes the emulator.

Hopefully it's right now.\n\nJust about everything should look great now. It took 25 days, but we\nfinally have the BIOS rendering correctly.\n\nIn order to do OBJ windows, I had to drop my above/below buffers\nentirely. I went with the nuclear option.  There's separate layers for\nall BGs and objects. I build the OBJ window table during object\nrendering.  So as a result, after rendering I go back and apply windows\n(and the object window that now exists.) After that, I have to do\na painful Z-buffer select of the top two most important pixels.  Since\nI now know the layers, the blending enable tests are a lot nicer, at\nleast.  But this obviously has quite a speed hit: 390fps to 325fps for\nMr. Driller 2 title screen.\n\nTONC says that \"bad\" window coordinates do really insane things. GBAtek\nsays it's a simple y2 < y1 || y2 > 160 ? 160 : y2; x2 < x1 || x2 > 240\n? 240 : x2; I like the GBAtek version more, so I went with that. I sure\nhope it's right ... but my guess is the hardware does this with\na counter that wraps around or something.  Also, say you have two OBJ\nmode 2 sprites that overlap each other, but with different priorities.\nThe lower (more important) priority sprite has a clear pixel, but the\nhigher priority sprite has a set pixel. Do we set the \"inside OBJ\nwindow\" flag to true here? Eg does the value OR, or does it hold the\nmost important sprite's pixel value? Cydrak suspects it's OR-based,\nI concur from what I can see.\n\nMosaic, I am at a loss. I really need a lot more information in order to\nimplement it.  For backgrounds, does it apply to the Vcounter of the\nentire screen? Or does it apply post-scroll? Or does it even apply after\nevery adjust in affine/bitmap modes?  I'm betting the hcounter\nbackground mosaic starts at the leftmost edge of the screen, and repeats\nprevious pixels to apply the effect. Like SNES, very simple.  For\nsprites, the SNES didn't have this. Does the mosaic grid start at (0,0)\nof the screen, or at (0,0) of each sprite? The latter will look a lot\nnicer, but be a lot more complex. Is mosaic on affine objects any\ndifferent than mosaic of linear(tiled) objects?\n\nWith that out of the way, we still have to fix the CPU memory access\ntiming, add the rest of the CPU penalty cycles, the memory rotation\n/ alignment / extend behavior needs to be fixed, the shifter desperately\nneeds to be moved from loops to single shift operations, and I need to\nadd flash memory support."], "commit_time": ["2012-04-13T11:49:32Z"]},

They\nwill be removed for v098r01.\n\nPlease test this WIP as much as you can. I intend to release v098 soon.\nI know save states are a little unstable for the WS/WSC, but they work\nwell enough for a release. If I can't figure it out soon, I'm going to\npost v098 anyway.\n\n[1] this one's been a really long time coming, but ... one of the bugs\nI found when I translated Tekkaman Blade was that my translation patch\nwould crash every now and again when you hit the reset button on a real\nSNES, but it always worked upon power on.\n\nTurns out that while power-on initializes the stack register to $01ff,\nreset does things a little bit differently. Reset actually triggers the\nreset interrupt vector after putting the CPU into emulation mode, but it\ndoesn't initialize the stack pointer. The net effect is that the stack\nhigh byte is set to $01, and the low byte is left as it was. And then\nthe reset vector runs, which pushes the low 16-bits of the program\ncounter, plus the processor flags, onto the stack frame. So you can\nactually tell where the game was at when the system was reset ... sort\nof.\n\nIt's a really weird behavior to be sure. But here's the catch: say\nyou're hacking a game, and so you hook the reset vector with jsl\nshowMyTranslationCreditsSplashScreen, and inside this new subroutine,\nyou then perform whatever bytes you hijacked, and then initialize the\nstack frame to go about your business drawing the screen, and when\nyou're done, you return via rtl.\n\nGenerally, this works fine. But if S={0100, 0101, or 0102}, then the\nstack will wrap due to being in emulation mode at reset. So it will\nwrite to {0100, 01ff, 01fe}. But now in your subroutine, you enable\nnative mode. So when you return from your subroutine hijack, it reads\nthe return address from {01ff, 0200, 0201} instead of the expected\n{01ff, 0100, 0101}. Thus, you get an invalid address back, and you\n\"return\" to the wrong location, and your program dies.\n\nThe odds of this happening depend on how the game handles S, but\ngenerally speaking, it's a ~1:85 chance.\n\nBy emulating this behavior, I'll likely expose this bug in many ROM\nhacks that do splash screen hooks like this, including my own Tekkaman\nBlade translation. And it's also very possible that there are commercial\ngames that screw this up as well.\n\nBut, it's what the real system does. So if any crashes start happening\nas of this WIP upon resetting the game, well ... it'd happen on real\nhardware, too."], "commit_time": ["2016-04-03T11:17:20Z"]},

This fixed\na strange main/subscreen misalignment issue, so I was able to restore\nthe proper sub-then-main rendering for the final screen output stage.\nCode looks a good bit cleaner this way overall.\n\nI also added load state and save state menus to the tools menu, so you\ncan use the menubar to load and save to ten slots. I am thinking that\nI should nuke the icons. As pretty as they are, it's getting tiresome\ntrying to find icons for everything, I have no pictures to represent\nloading or saving a slot, nor to represent individual slots. I'll just\nstick to radios and checkboxes."], "commit_time": ["2010-09-05T23:08:03Z"]},

Rather than arbitrary version\nnumbers, all of my software simply bumps version numbers by one for each\nofficial release. As such, higan v100 is simply higan's 100th release.\n\nThat said, the primary focus of this release has been code\nclean-ups. These are always somewhat dangerous in that regressions are\npossible. We've tested through sixteen WIP revisions, one of which was\nopen to the public, to try and minimize any regressions. But all the same,\nplease report any regressions if you discover any.\n\nChangelog (since v099):\nFC: render during pixels 1-256 instead of 0-255 [hex_usr]\nFC: rewrote controller emulation code\nSFC: 8% speedup over the previous release thanks to PPU optimizations\nSFC: fixed nasty DB address wrapping regression from v099\nSFC: USART developer controller removed; superseded by 21fx\nSFC: Super Multitap option removed from controller port 1; ports\n    renamed 2-5\nSFC: hidden option to experiment with 128KB VRAM (strictly for novelty)\nhigan: audio volume no longer divided by number of audio streams\nhigan: updated controller polling code to fix possible future mapping\n    issues\nhigan: replaced nall/stream with nall/vfs for file-loading subsystem\ntomoko: can now load multi-slotted games via command-line\ntomoko: synchronize video removed from UI; still available in the\n    settings file\ntomoko, icarus: can navigate to root drive selection on Windows\nall: major code cleanups and refactoring (~1MB diff against v099)\n\nNote 1: the audio volume change means that SGB and MSU1 games won't\nlose half the volume on the SNES sounds anymore. However, if one goes\noverboard and drives the sound all the way to max volume with the MSU1,\nclamping may occur. The obvious solution is not to drive volume that high\n(it will vastly overpower the SNES audio, which usually never exceeds\n25% volume.) Another option is to lower the volume in the audio settings\npanel to 50%. In general, neither is likely to ever be necessary.\n\nNote 2: the synchronize video option was hidden from the UI because it\nis no longer useful. With the advent of compositors, the loss of the\ncomplicated timing settings panel, support for the WonderSwan and its\n75hz display, the need to emulate variable refresh rate behaviors in the\nGame Boy, the unfortunate latency spike and audio distortion caused by\nlong Vsync pauses, and the arrival of adaptive sync technology ... it\nno longer makes sense to present this option. However, as stated, you\ncan edit settings.bml to enable this option anyway if you insist and\nunderstand the aforementioned risks.\n\nChangelog (since v099r16 open beta):\n\n- fixed MSU1 audio sign extension\n- fixed compilation with SGB support disabled\n- icarus can now navigate to root directory\n- fixed compilation issues with OS X port\n- (hopefully) fixed label height issue with hiro that affected icarus\n  import dialog\n- (mostly) fixed BS Memory, Sufami Turbo slot loading\n\nErrata:\n\n- forgot to remove the \" - Slot A\", \" - Slot B\" suffixes for Sufami\n  Turbo slot loading\n  - this means you have to navigate up one folder and then into Sufami\n    Turbo/ to load games for this system\n- moving WonderSwan orientation controls to the device slot is causing\n  some nastiness\n  - can now select orientation from the main menu, but it doesn't rotate\n    the display"], "commit_time": ["2016-07-08T12:04:32Z"]},

We were successful in emulating the Cx4 using LLE\nduring my vacation. We finished on June 15th. And now that I'm back,\nI've rewritten the code and merged it into bsnes official. With that,\nthe very last HLE emulation code in bsnes has now been purged.\n\n[...]\n\nThe emulation is as minimal as possible. If I don't see an opcode or\nfeature actually used, I don't implement it. The one exception being\nthat I do support the vector override functionality. And there are also\ndummy handlers for ld ?,$2e + loop, so that the chip won't stall out.\nBut things like \"byte 4\" on rdram/wrram, the two-bit destination\nselections for all but ld, etc are treated as invalid opcodes, since we\naren't 100% sure if they are there and work as we hypothesize. I also\nonly map in known registers into the 256-entry register list. This\nleaves 90% of the map empty.\n\nThe chip runs at 20MHz, and it will disable the ROM while running. DMA\ndoes transfer one byte at a time against the clock and also locks out\nthe ROM. rdbus won't fetch from IRAM, only from ROM. DMA transfer only\nreads from ROM, and only writes to RAM. Unless someone verifies that\nthey can do more, I'll leave it that way. I don't yet actually buffer\nthe program ROM into the internal program RAM just yet, but that is on\nthe to-do list. We aren't entirely sure how that works either, but my\nplan is to just lock the Cx4 CPU and load in 512-bytes.\n\nThere's still a few unknown registers in $7f40-5f that I don't do\nanything with yet. The secondary chip disable is going to be the\nweirdest one, since MMX3 only has one chip. I'd really rather not have\nto specify the ROM mapping as two separate chips on MMX2 and as one on\nMMX3 just to support this, so I don't know yet.\n\nSave state support is of course there already.\n\nSpeed hit is 118fps HLE -> 109fps LLE in most scenes.

This is a very early,\nunpolished, buggy release. But help testing/fixing bugs would be greatly\nappreciated for anyone willing.\n\nRequirements:\n- Mac OS X 10.7+\n- Xcode 7.2+\n\nInstallation Commands:\n\n    cd higan\n    gmake -j 4\n    gmake install\n    cd ../icarus\n    gmake -j 4\n    gmake install\n\n(gmake install is absolutely required, sorry. You'll be missing key\nfiles in key places if you don't run it, and nothing will work.)\n\n(gmake uninstall also exists, or you can just delete the .app bundles\nfrom your Applications folder, and the Dev folder on your desktop.)\n\nIf you want to use the GBA emulation, then you need to drop the GBA BIOS\ninto ~/Emulation/System/Game\\ Boy\\ Advance.sys\\bios.rom\n\nUsage:\nYou'll now find higan.app and icarus.app in your Applications folders.\nFirst, run icarus.app, navigate to where you keep your game ROMs. Now\nclick the settings button at the bottom right, and check \"Create\nManifests\", and click OK. (You'll need to do this every time you run\nicarus because there's some sort of bug on OSX saving the settings.) Now\nclick \"Import\", and let it bring in your games into ~/Emulation.\n\nNote: \"Create Manifests\" is required. I don't yet have a pipe\nimplementation on OS X for higan to invoke icarus yet. If you don't\ncheck this box, it won't create manifest.bml files, and your games won't\nrun at all.\n\nNow you can run higan.app. The first thing you'll want to do is go to\nhigan->Preferences... and assign inputs for your gamepads. At the very\nleast, do it for the default controller for all the systems you want to\nemulate.\n\nNow this is very important ... close the application at this point so\nthat it writes your config file to disk. There's a serious crashing bug,\nand if you trigger it, you'll lose your input bindings.\n\nNow the really annoying part ... go to Library->{System} and pick the\ngame you want to play. Right now, there's a ~50% chance the application\nwill bomb. It seems the hiro::pListView object is getting destroyed, yet\nsomehow the internal Cocoa callbacks are being triggered anyway. I don't\nknow how this is possible, and my attempts to debug with lldb have been\na failure :(\n\nIf you're unlucky, the application will crash. Restart and try again. If\nit crashes every single time, then you can try launching your game from\nthe command-line instead. Example:\n\n    open /Applications/higan.app \\\n\t--args ~/Emulation/Super\\ Famicom/Zelda3.sfc/\n\nHelp wanted:\nI could really, really, really use some help with that crashing on game\nloading. There's a lot of rough edges, but they're all cosmetic.

Registers are now\njust simple `uint24` or `uint16` types (technically they're `Natural<T>`\ntypes, but then all of higan uses those), flags are now just bool types.\nI also eliminated all of the implicit object state inside of the core\n(aa, rd, dp, sp) and instead do all computations on the stack frame with\nlocal variables. Through using macros to reference the registers and\nindividual parts of them, I was able to reduce the visual tensity of all\nof the instructions. And by using normal types without implicit states,\nI was able to eliminate about 15% of the instructions necessary, instead\nreusing existing ones.\n\nThe final third phase of the rewrite will be to recode the disassembler.\nThat code is probably the oldest code in all of higan right now, still\nusing sprintf to generate the output. So it is very long overdue for a\ncleanup.\n\nAnd now for the bad news ... as with any large code cleanup, regression\nerrors have seeped in. Currently, no games are running at all. I've left\nthe old disassembler in for this reason: we can compare trace logs of\nv102r23 against trace logs of v102r25. The second there's any\ndifference, we've spotted a buggy instruction and can correct it.\n\nWith any luck, this will be the last time I ever rewrite the wdc65816\ncore.

It sounds easy enough,\nbut it's insanely difficult. I ended up taking one small shortcut, in\nthat rather than fetch at -7, I fetch at the first instance where a tile\nis needed to plot to x=0. So if you have {-3 to +4 } as a tile, it\nfetches at -3. That won't work so well on hardware, if two BGs fetch at\nthe same X offset, they won't have time.\n\nI have had no luck staggering the reads at BG1=-7, BG3=-5, etc. While\nI can shift and fetch just fine, what happens is that when a new tile is\nfetched in, that gives a new palette, priority, etc; and this ends up\nhappening between two tiles which results in the right-most edges of the\nscreen ending up with the wrong colors and such.\n\nOffset-per-tile is cheap as always. Although looking at it, I'm not sure\nhow BG3 could pre-fetch, especially with the way one or two OPT modes\ncan fetch two tiles.\n\nThere's no magic in Hoffset caching yet, so the SMW1 pixel issue is\nstill there.\n\nMode 7 got a bugfix, it was off-by-one horizontally from the mosaic\ncode. After re-designing the BG mosaic, I ended up needing a separate\nmosaic for Mode7, and in the process I fixed that bug. The obvious\nchange is that the Chrono Trigger Mode7->Mode2 transition doesn't cause\nthe pendulum to jump anymore.\n\nWindows were simplified just a tad. The range testing is shared for all\nmodes now. Ironically, it's a bit slower, but I'll take less code over\nmore speed for the accuracy core.\n\nSpeaking of speed, because there's so much less calculations per pixel\nfor BGs, performance for the entire emulator has gone up by 30% in the\naccuracy core.

By doing this, it will be possible to stack filters.\nHowever, it's a bit complicated: I need to plan how the stacking should\noccur (eg we never want to apply scanlines before HQ2x, etc.)\nAdded input frequency adjustments for all three systems. I can easily\nget perfect video/audio sync on all three now, hooray.\nLong-term, it seems like we only really need one, and we can do\na video/audio delta to get an adjusted value. But for now, this gets the\njob done.\nAdded audio volume adjust. I left out the balance for now, since it's\nobviously impossible to balance the NES' single channel audio (I can\nduplicate the channel, and do twice the filtering work, but ... why?)\nI replaced NTSC/PAL TV mode selection with an \"Enable Overscan\"\ncheckbox. On, you get 240 lines on NES+SNES. Off, you get 224 lines on\nNES+SNES.\nAlso added aspect correction box back. I don't do that gross PAL\ndistortion shit anymore, sorry PAL people. I just scale up the\n54/47*(240/224) aspect correction for overscan off mode.\nAll memory is loaded and saved now, for all three systems (hooray, now\nyou can actually play Zelda 1&2.)\nAdded all of the old bsnes hotkeys, with the exception of capture\nscreenshot. May add again later. May come up with something a bit\ndifferent for extra features.\nRe-added the NSS DIP switch setting window. Since geometry is saved,\nI didn't want to auto-hide rows, so now you'll see all eight possible\nDIPs, and the ones not used are grayed out.\nUltimately, nobody will notice since we only have DIPs for ActRaiser\nNSS, and nobody's probably even using the XML file for that anyway.\nWhatever, it's nice to have anyway.\nTook FitzRoy's advice and single-item combo boxes on the input selection\nare disabled, so the user doesn't waste time checking them.\nI wanted to leave text so that you know there's not a problem. Qt\ndisabled radio box items look almost exactly like enabled ones.\nFixed lots of issues in phoenix and extended it a bit. But I was still\nhaving trouble with radio box grouping, so I said fuck it and made the\npanels show/hide based instead of append/remove based.\nThat's all for stuff off the checklist, I did a bunch of other things\nI don't recall.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say the GUI is 100% usable now. This is my opinion on how\nmulti-platform GUIs should be done =)\n\nOh, I figure I should mention, but the NES core is GPLv3, and all future\nSNES+GB releases will be as well.

The problem is that the ARM core has 28 unique\nbits, which is just far too many bits to have a full lookup table like\nthe 16-bit 68K core.\n\nThe thing I wanted more than anything else was to perform the opcode\nbitfield decoding once, and have it decoded for both instructions and\nthe disassembler. It took three hours to come up with a design that\nworked for the ARM half ... relying on #defines being able to pull in\nother #defines that were declared and changed later after the first\none. But, I'm happy with it. The decoding is in the table building, as\nit is with the 68K core. The decoding does happen at run-time on each\ninstruction invocation, but it has to be done.\n\nAs to the THUMB core, I can create a 64K-entry lambda table to cover all\npossible encodings, and ... even though it's a cache killer, I've\ndecided to go for it, given the outstanding performance it obtained in\nthe M68K core, as well as considering that THUMB mode is far more common\nin GBA games.\n\nAs to both cores ... I'm a little torn between two extremes:\n\nOn the one hand, I can condense the number of ARM/THUMB instructions\nfurther to eliminate more redundant code. On the other, I can split them\napart to reduce the number of conditional tests needed to execute each\ninstruction. It's really the disassembler that makes me not want to\nsplit them up further ... as I have to split the disassembler functions\nup equally to the instruction functions. But it may be worth it if it's\na speed improvement."], "commit_time": ["2017-08-07T12:20:35Z"]},

I really went to town on cleaning up the\nsource today with all kinds of new ideas. I'll post the ones I remember,\nuse diff -ru to get the rest.\n\nWhat I like the most is my new within template:\n\n    template<unsigned lo, unsigned hi>\n    alwaysinline bool within(unsigned addr) {\n      static const unsigned mask = ~(hi ^ lo);\n      return (addr & mask) == lo;\n    }\n\nBefore, you would see code like this:\n\n    if((addr & 0xe0e000) == 0x206000) {  //$20-3f:6000-7fff\n\nThe comment is basically necessary, and you have to trust that the mask\nis right, or do the math yourself.\n\nNow, it looks like this:\n\n    if(within<0x20, 0x3f, 0x6000, 0x7fff>(addr)) {\n\nThat's the same as within<0x206000, 0x3f7fff>, I just made an\nSNES-variant to more closely simulate my XML mapping style:\n20-3f:6000-7fff.\n\nNow obviously this has limitations, it only works in base-2 and it can't\nmanage some tricky edge cases like (addr & 0x408000) == 0x008000 for\n00-3f|80-bf:8000-ffff. But for the most part, I'll be using this where\nI can. The Game Boy is fully ported over to it (via the MBCs), but the\nSNES only has the BS-X town cartridge moved over so far. SuperFX and\nSA-1 at the very least could benefit.\n\nNext up, since the memory map is now static, there's really no reason to\nremap the entire thing at power-on and reset. So it is now set up at\ncartridge load and that's it. I moved the CPU/PPU/WRAM mapping out of\nmemory.cpp and into their respective processors. A bit of duplication\nonly because there are multiple processor cores for the different\nprofiles, but I'm not worried about that. This is also going to be\nnecessary to fix the debugger.\n\nNext, Coprocessor::enable() actually does what I initially intended it\nto now: it is called once to turn a chip on after cartridge load. It's\nnot called on power cycle anymore. This should help fix power-cycle on\nmy serial simulation code, and was needed to map the bus exactly one\ntime. Although most stuff is mapped through XML, some chips still need\nsome manual hooks for monitoring and such (eg S-DD1.)\n\nNext, I've started killing off memory::, it was initially an\nover-reaction to the question of where to put APURAM (in the SMP or\nDSP?). The idea was to have this namespace that contained all memory for\neverything. But it was very annoying and tedious, and various chips\nignored the convention anyway like ST-0011 RAM, which couldn't work\nanyway since it is natively uint16 and not uint8. Cx4 will need 24-bit\nRAM eventually, too. There's 8->24-bit functions in there now, because\nthe HLE code is hideous.\n\nSo far, all the cartridge.cpp memory:: types have been destroyed.\nmemory::cartrom, memory::cartram become cartridge.rom and cartridge.ram.\nmemory::cartrtc was moved into the SRTC and SPC7110 classes directly.\nmemory::bsxflash was moved into BSXFlash. memory::bsxram and\nmemory::bsxpram were moved into BSXCartridge (the town cartridge).\nmemory::st[AB](rom|ram) were moved into a new area,\nsnes/chip/sufamiturbo. The snes/chip moniker really doesn't work so\nwell, since it also has base units, and the serial communications stuff\nwhich is through the controller port, but oh well, now it also has the\nbase structure for the Sufami Turbo cartridge too. So now we have\nsufamiturbo.slotA.rom, sufamiturbo.slotB.ram, etc.\n\nNext, the ST-0010/ST-0011 actually save the data RAM to disk. This\nwasn't at all compatible with my old system, and I didn't want to keep\nadding memory types to check inside the main UI cartridge RAM loading\nand saving routines.\n\nSo I built a NonVolatileRAM vector inside SNES::Cartridge, and any chip\nthat has memory it wants to save and load from disk can append onto it\n: data, size, id (\"srm\", \"rtc\", \"nec\", etc) and slot (0 = cartridge,\n1 = slot A, 2 = slot B)\n\nTo load and save memory, we just do a simple: foreach(memory,\nSNES::cartridge.nvram) load/saveMemory(memory).\n\nAs a result, you can now keep your save games in F1 Race of Champions II\nand Hayazashi Nidan Morita Shougi. Technically I think Metal Combat\nshould work this way as well, having the RAM being part of the chip\nitself, but for now that chip just writes directly into cartridge.ram,\nso it also technically saves to disk for now.\n\nTo avoid a potential conflict with a manipulated memory map, BS-X SRAM\nand PSRAM are now .bss and .bsp, and not .srm and .psr. Honestly I don't\nlike .srm as an extension either, but it doesn't bother me enough to\nbreak save RAM compatibility with other emulators, so don't worry about\nthat changing.\n\nI finally killed off MappedRAM initializing size to ~0 (-1U). A size of\nzero means there is no memory there just the same. This was an old\nholdover for handling MMIO mapping, if I recall correctly. Something\nabout a size of zero on MMIO-Memory objects causing it to wrap the\naddress, so ~0 would let it map direct addresses ... or something.\nWhatever, that's not needed at all anymore.\n\nBSXBase becomes BSXSatellaview, and I've defaulted the device to being\nattached since it won't affect non-BSX games anyway. Eventually the GUI\nneeds to make that an option. BSXCart becomes BSXCartridge. BSXFlash\nremains unchanged.\n\nI probably need to make Coprocessor::disable() functions now to free up\nmemory on unload, but it shouldn't hurt anything the way it is.\n\nlibsnes is most definitely broken to all hell and back now, and the\ndebugger is still shot. I suppose we'll need some tricky code to work\nwith the old ID system, and we'll need to add some more IDs for the new\nmemory types."], "commit_time": ["2011-01-24T08:59:45Z"]},

Once I've finished all the\n    boards, then I'll update the heuristics.\n\n    Then finally, I'll sync the syntax changes over to the fc, gb, gba\n    cores.\n\n    Once that's done, I'll start posting WIPs again, along with a new\n    build of icarus.\n\n    But I'll still post changelogs as I work through things.\n\n    Changelog (r13):\n    - preservation: created new database-builder tool (merges\n      region-specific databases with boards)\n    - icarus: support new, external database format\n      (~/.config/icarus/Database/(Super Famicom.bml, ...)\n    - added 1A3B-(10,11,12); 1A3B-20\n\nbyuu says about r14:\n\n    r14 work:\n\n    I successfully created mappings for every board used in the US set.\n\n    I also updated icarus' heuristics to use the new mappings, and\n    created ones there for the boards that are only in the JP set.\n\n    Then I patched icarus to support pulling games out of the database\n    when it's used on a game folder to generate a manifest file.\n\n    Then I updated a lot of code in higan/sfc to support the new mapping\n    syntax. sfc/cartridge/markup.cpp is about half the size it used to\n    be with the new mappings, and I was able to kill off both map/id and\n    map/select entirely.\n\n    Then I updated all four emulated systems (and both subsystems) to\n    use \"board\" as the root node, and harmonized their syntax (made them\n    all more consistent with each other.)\n\n    Then I added a manifest viewer to the tools window+menu. It's kind\n    of an advanced user feature, but oh well. No reason to coddle people\n    when the feature is very useful for developers. The viewer will show\n    all manifests in order when you load multi-cart games as well.\n\n    Still not going to call any syntax 100% done right now, but\n    thankfully with the new manifest-free folders, nobody will have to\n    do anything to use the new format. Just download the new version and\n    go.\n\n    The Super Famicom Event stuff is currently broken (CC92/PF94\n    boards). That's gonna be fun to support.\n\nbyuu says about r15:\n\n    EDIT: small bug in icarus with heuristics. Edit\n    core/super-famicom.cpp line 27:\n\n\tif(/*auto*/ markup = cartridge.markup) {\n\n    Gotta remove that \"auto\" so that it returns valid markup.\n\n    Resolved the final concerns I had with the new manifest format.\n\n    Right now there are two things that are definitely broken: MCC (BS-X\n    Town cart) and Event (CC '92 and PF'94).\n    And there are a few things that are untested: SPC7110, EpsonRTC,\n    SharpRTC, SDD1+RAM, SufamiTurbo, BS-X slotted carts."], "commit_time": ["2015-12-19T08:52:34Z"]},

Now to await posts about this in four more threads\nagain ;)\n\nChangelog:\n\n  - GBA: rewrote PPU from a scanline-based renderer to a pixel-based\n    renderer\n  - ruby: fixed video/gdi bugs\n\nNote that there's an approximately 21% speed penalty compared to v102r18\nfor the pixel-based renderer.\n\nAlso, horizontal mosaic effects are not yet implemented. But they should\nbe prior to v103. This one is a little tricky as it currently works on\nfully rendered scanlines. I need to roll the mosaic into the background\nrenderers, and then for sprites, well ... see below.\n\nThe trickiest part by far of this new renderer is the object (sprite)\nsystem. Unlike every other system I emulate, the GBA supports affine\nrendering of its sprites. Or in other words, rotation effects. And it\nalso has a very complex priority system.\n\nRight now, I can't see any way that the GBA PPU could render pixels in\nreal-time like this. My belief is that there's a 240-entry buffer that\nfills up the next scanline's row of pixels. Which means it probably also\nruns on the last scanline of Vblank so that the first scanline has\nsprite data.\n\nHowever, I didn't design my object renderer like this just yet. For now,\nit creates a buffer of all 240 pixels right away at the start of the\nscanline. I know\\!\\! That's technically scanline-based. But it's only\nfor fetching object tiledata, and it's only temporary.\n\nWhat needs to happen is I need a way to run something like a \"mini libco\nthread\" inside of the main thread, so that the object renderer can run\nin parallel with the rest of the PPU, yet not be a hideous abomination\nof a state machine, yet also not be horrendously slow as a full libco\nthread would be.\n\nI'm envisioning some kind of stackless yielding coroutine. But I'll need\nto think through how to design that, given the absence of coroutines\neven in C++17."], "commit_time": ["2017-06-04T03:16:44Z"]},

This gives navigation capabilities to\ngame loading, and it also completes our slotted cart selection code. As\nan added bonus, it's less code this way, too.\n\nI also set the window size to consistent sizes between all emulated\nsystems, so that switching between SFC and GB don't cause the window\nsize to keep changing, and so that the scaling size is consistent (eg at\nnormal scale, GB @ 3x is closer to SNES @ 2x.) This means black borders\nin GB/GBA mode, but it doesn't look that bad, and it's not like many\npeople ever use these modes anyway.\n\nFinally, added the placeholder tabs for video, audio and timing. I don't\nintend to add the timing calculator code to v095 (it might be better as\na separate tool), but I'll add the ability to set video/audio rates, at\nleast.\n\nGlitch 1: despite selecting the first item in the BrowserDialog list, if\nyou press enter when the window appears, it doesn't activate the item\nuntil you press an arrow key first.\n\nGlitch 2: in Game Boy mode, if you set the 4x window size, it's not\nhonoring the full requested height because the viewport is smaller than\nthe window. 8+ years of trying to get GTK+ and Qt to simply set the god\ndamned window size I ask for, and I still can't get them to do it\nreliably.\n\nRemaining issues:\n- finish configuration panels (video, audio, timing)\n- fix ruby driver compilation on Windows\n- add DIP switch selection window (NSS) [I may end up punting this one\n  to v096]"], "commit_time": ["2015-05-30T11:39:09Z"]},

We've substantially reduced\nthe amount of boilerplate code everywhere, while still allowing (even\neasier than before) support for RAM-based game loading/saving. All of\nnall/stream is dead and buried.\n\nI am considering removing Emulator::Interface::Medium::id and/or\nbootable flag. Or at least, doing something different with it. The\nvalues for the non-bootable GB/BS/ST entries duplicate the ID that is\nsupposed to be unique. They are for GB/GBC and WS/WSC. Maybe I'll use\nthis as the hardware revision selection ID, and then gut non-bootable\noptions. There's really no reason for that to be there. I think at one\npoint I was using it to generate library tabs for non-bootable systems,\nbut we don't do that anymore anyway.\n\nEmulator::Interface::load() may not need the required flag anymore ... it\ndoesn't really do anything right now anyway.\n\nI have a few reasons for having the cores load the base cartridge. Most\nimportantly, it is going to enable a special mode for the WonderSwan /\nWonderSwan Color in the future. If we ever get the IPLROMs dumped ... it's\npossible to boot these systems with no games inserted to set user profile\ninformation and such. There are also other systems that may accept being\nbooted without a cartridge. To reach this state, you would load a game and\nthen cancel the load dialog. Right now, this results in games not loading.\n\nThe second reason is this prevents nasty crashes when loading fails. So\nif you're missing a required manifest, the emulator won't die a violent\ndeath anymore. It's able to back out at any point.\n\nThe third reason is consistency: loading the base cartridge works the\nsame as the slot cartridges.\n\nThe fourth reason is Emulator::Interface::open(uint pathID)\nvalues. Before, the GB, SB, GBC modes were IDs 1,2,3 respectively. This\ncomplicated things because you had to pass the correct ID. But now\ninstead, Emulator::Interface::load() returns maybe<uint> that is nothing\nwhen no game is selected, and a pathID for a valid game. And now open()\ncan take this ID to access this game's folder contents.\n\nThe downside, which is temporary, is that command-line loading is\ncurrently broken. But I do intend on restoring it. In fact, I want to do\nbetter than before and allow multi-cart booting from the command-line by\nspecifying the base cartridge and then slot cartridges. The idea should\nbe pretty simple: keep a queue of pending filenames that we fill from\nthe command-line and/or drag-and-drop operations on the main window,\nand then empty out the queue or prompt for load dialogs from the UI\nwhen booting a system. This also might be a bit more unorthodox compared\nto the traditional emulator design of \"loadGame(filename)\", but ... oh\nwell. It's easy enough still.\n\nThe port/device changes are fun. We simplified things quite a bit. The\nportmask stuff is gone entirely. While ports and devices keep IDs,\nthis is really just sugar-coating so UIs can use for(auto& port :\nemulator->ports) and access port.id; rather than having to use for(auto\nn : range(emulator->ports)) { auto& port = emulator->ports[n]; ... };\nbut they should otherwise generally be identical to the order they appear\nin their respective ranges. Still, don't rely on that.\n\nInput::id is gone. There was no point since we also got rid of the nasty\nInput::order vector. Since I was in here, I went ahead and caved on the\npedantics and renamed Input::guid to Input::userData.\n\nI removed the SNES controller port 1 multitap option. Basically, the only\ngame that uses this is N-warp Daisakusen and, no offense to d4s, it's\nnot really a good game anyway. It's just a quick demo to show 8-players\non the SNES. But in the UI, all it does is confuse people into wasting\ntime mapping a controller they're never going to use, and they're going\nto wonder which port to use. If more compelling use cases for 8-players\ncomes about, we can reconsider this. I left all the code to support this\nin place, so all you have to do is uncomment one line to enable it again.\n\nWe now have dsnes emulation! :D\nIf you change PPU::VRAM::size to 0x10000 (words), then you should now\nhave 128KiB of VRAM. Even better, it serializes the used-VRAM size,\nso your save states shouldn't crash on you if you swap between the two\n(though if you try this, you're nuts.)\n\nNote that this option does break commercial software. Yoshi's Island in\nparticular. This game is setting A15 on some PPU register writes, but\nnot on others. The end result of this is things break horribly in-game.\n\nAlso, this option is causing a very tiny speed hit for obvious reasons\nwith the variable masking value (I'm even using size-1 for now.) Given\nhow niche this is, I may just leave it a compile-time constant to avoid\nthe overhead cost. Otherwise, if we keep the option, then it'll go into\nSuper Famicom.sys/manifest.bml ... I'll flesh that out in the near-future.\n\n----\n\nFinally, some fun for my OCD ... my monitor suddenly cut out on me\nin the middle of working on this WIP, about six hours in of non-stop\nwork. Had to hit a bunch of ctrl+alt+fN commands (among other things)\nand trying to log in headless on another TTY to do issue commands,\ntrying to recover the display. Finally power cycled the monitor and it\ncame back up. So all my typing ended up going to who knows where.\n\nUsually this sort of thing terrifies me enough that I scrap a WIP and\nstart over to ensure I didn't screw anything up during the crashed screen\nwhen hitting keys randomly.\n\nObviously, everything compiles and appears to work fine. And I know\nit's extremely paranoid, but OCD isn't logical, so ... I'm going\nto go over every line of the 100KiB r07->r08 diff looking for any\ncorruption/errors/whatever.\n\n----\n\nReview finished.\n\nr08 diff review notes:\n- fc/controller/gamepad/gamepad.cpp:\n  use uint device = ID::Device::Gamepad; not id = ...;\n- gb/cartridge/cartridge.hpp:\n  remove redundant uint _pathID; (in Information::pathID already)\n- gb/cartridge/cartridge.hpp:\n  pull sha256 inside Information\n- sfc/cartridge/load/cpp:\n  add \" - Slot (A,B)\" to interface->load(\"Sufami Turbo\"); to be more\n  descriptive\n- sfc/controller/gamepad/gamepad.cpp:\n  use uint device = ID::Device::Gamepad; not id = ...;\n- sfc/interface/interface.cpp:\n  remove n variable from the Multitap device input generation loop\n  (now unused)\n- sfc/interface/interface.hpp:\n  put struct Port above struct Device like the other classes\n- ui-tomoko:\n  cheats.bml is reading from/writing to mediumPaths(0) [system folder\n  instead of game folder]\n- ui-tomoko:\n  instead of mediumPaths(1) - call emulator->metadataPathID() or something\n  like that"], "commit_time": ["2016-06-24T12:16:53Z"]},

The one exception is the Emulator::Interface instance. I can\nabsolutely make that a global object, but only in bsnes where there's\njust the one emulation core.\n\nI also moved all the SettingsWindow and ToolsWindow panels out to their\nown global objects, and fixed a very difficult bug with GTK TabFrame\ncontrols.\n\nThe configuration settings panel is now the emulator settings panel. And\nI added some spacing between bold label sections on both the emulator\nand driver settings panels.\n\nI gave fixing ComboButtonItem my best shot, given I can't reproduce the\ncrash. Probably won't work, though.\n\nAlso made a very slight consistency improvement to ruby and renamed\ndriverName() to driver().\n\n...\n\nAn important change ... as a result of moving bsnes to global objects,\nthis means that the constructors for all windows run before the\npresentation window is displayed. Before this change, only the\npresentation window was constructed first berore displaying it, followed\nby the construction of the rest of the GUI windows.\n\nThe upside to this is that as soon as you see the main window, the GUI\nis ready to go without a period where it's unresponsive.\n\nThe downside to this is it takes about 1.5 seconds to show the main\nwindow, compared to around 0.75 seconds before.\n\nI've no intention of changing that back. So if the startup time becomes\na problem, then we'll just have to work on optimizing hiro, so that it\ncan construct all the global Window objects quicker. The main way to do\nthat would be to not do calls to the Layout::setGeometry functions for\nevery widget added, and instead wait until the window is displayed. But\nI don't have an easy way to do that, because you want the widget\ngeometry values to be sane even before the window is visible to help\nsize certain things."], "commit_time": ["2018-07-31T10:56:45Z"]},

If we don't do this, then resampling will introduce\naliasing that results in sounds that are audible to the human ear. Which\nbasically an annoying buzzing sound. You'll definitely hear the\nimprovement from these in games like Mega Man 2 on the NES. Of course,\nthese already existed before, so this WIP won't sound better than\nprevious WIPs.\n\nThe high-pass filters are a little more complicated. Their main role is\nto remove DC bias and help to center the audio stream. I don't\nunderstand how they do this at all, but ... that's what everyone who\nknows what they're talking about says, thus ... so be it.\n\nI have set all of the high-pass filters to 20Hz, which is below the\nlimit of human hearing. Now this is where it gets really interesting ...\ntechnically, some of these systems actually cut off a lot of range. For\ninstance, the GBA should technically use an 800Hz high-pass filter when\noutput is done through the system's speakers. But of course, if you plug\nin headphones, you can hear the lower frequencies.\n\nNow 800Hz ... you definitely can hear. At that level, nearly all of the\nbass is stripped out and the audio is very tinny. Just like the real\nsystem. But for now, I don't want to emulate the audio being crushed\nthat badly.\n\nI'm sticking with 20Hz everywhere since it won't negatively affect audio\nquality. In fact, you should not be able to hear any difference between\nthis WIP and the previous WIP. But theoretically, DC bias should mostly\nbe removed as a result of these new filters. It may be that we need to\nraise the values on some cores in the future, but I don't want to do\nthat until we know for certain that we have to.\n\nWhat I can say is that compared to even older WIPs than r15 ... the\nremoval of the simple one-pole low-pass and high-pass filters with the\nnewer three-pass, second-order filters should result in much better\nattenuation (less distortion of audible frequencies.)

since v067:\n\nThis release officially introduces the accuracy and performance cores,\nalongside the previously-existing compatibility core. The accuracy core\nallows the most accurate SNES emulation ever seen, with every last\nprocessor running at the lowest possible clock synchronization level.\nThe performance core allows slower computers the chance to finally use\nbsnes. It is capable of attaining 60fps in standard games even on an\nentry-level Intel Atom processor, commonly found in netbooks.\n\nThe accuracy core is absolutely not meant for casual gaming at all. It\nis meant solely for getting as close to 100% perfection as possible, no\nmatter the cost to speed. It should only be used for testing,\ndevelopment or debugging.\n\nThe compatibility core is identical to bsnes v067 and earlier, but is\nnow roughly 10% faster. This is the default and recommended core for\ncasual gaming.\n\nThe performance core contains an entirely new S-CPU core, with\nrange-tested IRQs; and uses blargg's heavily-optimized S-DSP core\ndirectly. Although there are very minor accuracy tradeoffs to increase\nspeed, I am confident that the performance core is still more accurate\nand compatible than any other SNES emulator. The S-CPU, S-SMP, S-DSP,\nSuperFX and SA-1 processors are all clock-based, just as in the accuracy\nand compatibility cores; and as always, there are zero game-specific\nhacks. Its compatibility is still well above 99%, running even the most\nchallenging games flawlessly.\n\nIf you have held off from using bsnes in the past due to its system\nrequirements, please give the performance core a try. I think you will\nbe impressed. I'm also not finished: I believe performance can be\nincreased even further.\n\nI would also strongly suggest Windows Vista and Windows 7 users to take\nadvantage of the new XAudio2 driver by OV2. Not only does it give you\na performance boost, it also lowers latency and provides better sound by\nway of skipping an API emulation layer.\n\nChangelog:\n- Split core into three profiles: accuracy, compatibility and\n  performance\n- Accuracy core now takes advantage of variable-bitlength integers (eg\n  uint24_t)\n- Performance core uses a new S-CPU core, written from scratch for speed\n- Performance core uses blargg's snes_dsp library for S-DSP emulation\n- Binaries are now compiled using GCC 4.5\n- Added a workaround in the SA-1 core for a bug in GCC 4.5+\n- The clock-based S-PPU renderer has greatly improved OAM emulation;\n  fixing Winter Gold and Megalomania rendering issues\n- Corrected pseudo-hires color math in the clock-based S-PPU renderer;\n  fixing Super Buster Bros backgrounds\n- Fixed a clamping bug in the Cx4 16-bit triangle operation [Jonas\n  Quinn]; fixing Mega Man X2 \"gained weapon\" star background effect\n- Updated video renderer to properly handle mixed-resolution screens\n  with interlace enabled; fixing Air Strike Patrol level briefing screen\n- Added mightymo's 2010-08-19 cheat code pack\n- Windows port: added XAudio2 output support [OV2]\n- Source: major code restructuring; virtual base classes for processor\n- cores removed, build system heavily modified, etc."], "commit_time": ["2010-08-22T01:02:42Z"]},

I'd be very curious to hear feedback from\npeople who objected to the old nall/stream design, whether they are\nhappy with the new file loading system or think it could use further\nimprovements.\n\nThe 16-bit VRAM turned out to be a wash on performance (roughly the same\nas before. 1fps slower on Zelda 3, 1fps faster on Yoshi's Island.) The\nmain reason for this was because Yoshi's Island was breaking horribly\nuntil I changed the vramRead, vramWrite functions to take uint15 instead\nof uint16.\n\nI suspect the issue is we're using uint16s in some areas now that need\nto be uint15, and this game is setting the VRAM address to 0x8000+,\ncausing us to go out of bounds on memory accesses.\n\nBut ... I want to go ahead and do something cute for fun, and just because\nwe can ... and this new interface is so incredibly perfect for it!! I\nwant to support an SNES unit with 128KiB of VRAM. Not out of the box,\nbut as a fun little tweakable thing. The SNES was clearly designed to\nsupport that, they just didn't use big enough VRAM chips, and left one\nof the lines disconnected. So ... let's connect it anyway!\n\nIn the end, if we design it right, the only code difference should be\none area where we mask by 15-bits instead of by 16-bits."], "commit_time": ["2016-06-24T12:09:30Z"]},

the added lines to hiro for\nselective component disabling. May as well get all the diff-noise apart\nfrom code changes.\n\nIt also merges something I've been talking to Cydrak about ... making\nnall::string::(integer,decimal) do built-in binary,octal,hex decoding\ninstead of just failing on those. This will have fun little side effects\nall over the place, like being able to view a topic on my forum via\n\"forum.byuu.org/topic/0b10010110\", heh.\n\nThere are two small changes to higan itself, though. First up, I fixed\nthe resampler ratio when loading non-SNES games. Tested and I can play\nGame Boy games fine now. Second, I hooked up menu option hiding for\nreset and controller selection. Right now, this works like higan v094,\nbut I'm thinking I might want to show the \"Device -> Controller\" even if\nthat's all that's there. It kind of jives nicer with the input settings\nwindow to see the labels there, I think. And if we ever do add more\nstuff, it'll be nice that people already always expect that menu there.\n\nRemaining issues:\n* add slotted cart loader (SGB, BSX, ST)\n* add DIP switch selection window (NSS)\n* add timing configuration (video/audio sync)"], "commit_time": ["2015-05-23T05:37:08Z"]},

If we want to filter frequencies below\n20KHz, then I can adapt Emulator::Audio::createStream() to take a cutoff\nfrequency value, and we can do it all at once, with much better quality.\n\nRight now, I don't know what frequencies are best to cut off the various\nother audio cores, so they're just gone for now.\n\nAs for the highpass filters for the Famicom core, well ... you don't get\naliasing from resampling low frequencies. And generally speaking, too\nlow a frequency will be inaudible anyway. All these were doing was\nkilling possible bass (if they were too strong.) We can add them again,\nbut only if someone can convert Ryphecha's ad-hoc magic integers into a\nfrequency cutoff. In which case, I'll use my biquad IIR filter to do it\neven better. On this note, it may prove useful to do this for the MD PSG\nas well, to try and head off unnecessary clamping when mixing with the\nYM2612.\n\nFinally, there was the audio centering issue that affected the\nMS,GG,MD,PCE,SG cores. It was flooring the \"silent\" audio level, which\nwas resulting in extremely heavy distortion if you tried listening to\nhigan and, say, audacious at the same time. Without the botched\ncentering, this distortion is completely gone now.\n\nHowever, without any centering, we've halved the potential volume range.\nThis means the audio slider in higan's audio settings panel will start\nclamping twice as quickly. So ultimately, we need to figure out how to\nfix the centering. This isn't as simple as just subtracting less. We\nwill probably have to center every individual audio channel before\nsumming them to do this properly.\n\nResults:\n\nOn the Mega Drive, Altered Beast sounds quite a bit better, a lot less\ndistortion now. But it's still not perfect, especially sound effects.\nFurther, Bare Knuckle / Streets of Rage still has really bad sound\neffects. It looks like I broke something in Cydrak's code when trying to\nadapt it to my style =("], "commit_time": ["2017-03-06T20:23:22Z"]},

Things worked out pretty great in the end.\n\nWe went from 22.0KiB (cartridge) + 18.6KiB (interface) to 24.5KiB\n(cartridge) + 11.4KiB (interface). Or 40.7KiB to 36.0KiB. This removes\na very large source of indirection. Before it was: \"coprocessor <=>\ncartridge <=> interface\" for loading and saving data, and now it's just\n\"coprocessor <=> cartridge\". And it may make sense to eventually turn\nthis into just \"cartridge -> coprocessor\" by making each coprocessor\nclass handle its own markup parsing.\n\nIt's nice to have all the manifest parsing in one location (well, sans\nMSU1); but it's also nice for loading/unloading to be handled by each\ncoprocessor itself. So I'll have to think longer about that one.\n\nI've also started handling Interface::save() differently. Instead of\nkeeping track of memory IDs and filenames, and iterating through that\nvector of objects ... instead I now have a system that mirrors the markup\nparsing on loading, but handles saving instead. This was actually the\nreason the code size savings weren't more significant, but I like this\nstyle more. As before, it removes an extra level of indirection.\n\nSo ... next up, I need to port over the GB, then GBA, then WS\ncores. These shouldn't take too long since they're all very simple with\njust ROM+RAM(+RTC) right now. Then get the SGB callbacks using vfs. Then\nafter that, gut all the old stream stuff from nall and higan.

It has the RAM region present, but returns\nlogic low (0x00) instead of open bus, when SRAM isn't present. I started\nby making it `map=ram` instead of `ram/map`, which is gross, and then it ended\nup detecing the map tag ending in RAM and pulling the Cx4 data RAM into that\nslot. Ugh. The preservation board mapping is still as it was before and will\nneed to be updated once I get the syntax down.\n\nThe BS Memory and Sufami Turbo moving to the new `game/memory`\nending means I can't use the SuperFamicom::Cartridge::loadMemory\nfunction that looks at the old-style rom/ram tags. Because I didn't\nwrite more code, the result is those sub-carts won't load now.\n\nThe old heuristics were short-circuiting on SA1 before bothering with\nBS-X slots, so that's why SD Gundam G-Next wasn't asking for a data\npack. The problem is, I don't know where the BS-X pack maps to on this\ncartridge. It's at c0-ef on the other BS-X slotted cartridges, but\nthat's mapped to the SA1 on regular SA1 cartridges, so ... for now, it's\nnot actually mapped in.\n\nI'm still struggling with naming conventions on all these boards.

"commit_description": ["\nbyuu says:\n\nFinally, a new release. I have been very busy finishing up SNES box,\ncartridge and PCB scanning plus cataloguing the data, however this\nrelease still has some significant improvements.\n\nMost notably would be randomization on startup. This will help match the\nbehavior of real hardware and uninitialized memory + registers. It\nshould help catch homebrew software that forgets to initialize things\nproperly. Of course, I was not able to test the complete library, so it\nis possible that if I've randomized anything that should be constant,\nthat this could cause a regression. You can disable this randomization\nfor netplay or to work around any incompatibilities by editing bsnes.cfg\nand setting snes.random to false.\n\nThe GUI also received some updates. Widget sizes are now computed based\non font sizes, giving it a perfectly native look (because it is native.)\nI've also added a hotkey remapping screen to the input settings. Not\nonly can you remap inputs to controllers now, but those who did not know\nthe hotkey bindings can now quickly see which ones exist and what they\nare mapped to.\n\nChangelog (since v077):\n\n- memory and most registers are now randomly initialized on power-up\n- fixed auto joypad polling issue in Super Star Wars\n- fixed .nec and .rtc file extensions (they were missing the dot) [krom]\n- PPU/accuracy now clears overscan region on any frame when it is\n  disabled\n- PPU/compatibility no longer auto-blends hires pixels (use NTSC filter\n  for this)\n- added hotkey remapping dialog to input settings window\n- added a few new hotkeys, including quick-reset\n- phoenix API now auto-sizes widgets based on font sizes\n- file dialog once again remembers previously selected file when\n  possible"], "commit_time": ["2011-04-30T13:12:15Z"]},

Hopefully I can get a solid WIP together soon. But for now...\n\nI've integrated dynamic rate control into ruby::Audio via\nsetDynamic(bool) for now. It's very demanding, as you would expect. When\nit's not in use, I realized the OSS driver's performance was pretty bad\ndue to calling write() for every sample for every channel. I implemented\na tiny 256-sample buffer and bsnes went from 290fps to 330fps on my\nFreeBSD desktop. It may be possible to do the same buffering with DRC,\nbut for now, I'm not doing so, and adjusting the audio input frequency\non every sample.\n\nI also added ruby::Video::setFlush(bool), which is available only in the\nOpenGL drivers, and this causes glFinish() to be called after swapping\ndisplay buffers. I really couldn't think of a good name for this, \"hard\nGPU sync\" sounds kind of silly. In my view, flush is what commits queued\nevents. Eg fflush(). OpenGL of course treats glFlush differently (I\nreally don't even know what the point of it is even after reading the\nmanual ...), and then has glFinish ... meh, whatever. It's\nsetFlush(bool) until I come up with something better. Also as expected,\nthis one's a big hit to performance.\n\nTo implement the DRC, I started putting helper functions into the ruby\nvideo/audio/input core classes. And then the XVideo driver started\ncrashing. It took hours and hours and hours to track down the problem:\nyou have to clear XSetWindowAttributes to zero before calling\nXCreateWindow. No amount of `--sync`, `gdb break gdk_x_error`, `-Og`,\netc will make Xlib be even remotely helpful in debugging errors like\nthis.\n\nThe GLX, GLX2, and XVideo drivers basically worked by chance before. If\nthe stack frame had the right memory cleared, it worked. Otherwise it'd\ncrash with BadValue, and my changing things broke that condition on the\nXVideo driver. So this has been fixed in all three now.\n\nOnce XVideo was running again, I realized that non-power of two video\nsizes were completely broken for the YUV formats. It took a while, but I\nmanaged to fix all of that as well.\n\nAt this point, most of ruby is going to be broken outside of FreeBSD, as\nI still need to finish updating all the drivers."], "commit_time": ["2018-07-28T11:21:39Z"]},

Added all of the findings\nfrom ", " that I understood.\n\nI also completely rewrote the RTC. We only had about ~40% of the chip\nemulated before. Turns out there's cool stuff like spare RAM, calendar\ndisable, 12-hour mode, IRQs, IRQ masking, duty cycles, etc. So I went\nahead and emulated all of it. The upper bits on hour+ don't work as\nnocash described though, not sure what doc he was reading. The Epson\nRTC-4513 manual I have doesn't explain any of the registers.\nThe new RTC core also ticks seconds based on the emulated clock, and not\non the system clock. This is going to suck for people wanting to keep\nthe in-game clock synced with their computer, who also abuse fast\nforward and save states. Fast forward makes the clock run faster, and\nsave states will jump the clock to the time it was at when you took the\nsave state. (It will keep track of the number of seconds between\nunloading the game and loading it again, so time passes normally there.)\nThis is required, however, and how I'm going to rearrange all of the\nRTCs for all systems. Any other method can be detected by the game, and\nis thus not faithful emulation. To help with this, I'll probably make an\nRTC time tool so that you can adjust the time when the emulator isn't\nrunning, but I don't intend to bundle that into bsnes.\nNew state format bit-packs the RTCRAM values, and it also uses a 64-bit\ntimestamp. So it's 16 bytes now instead of 20 bytes. S-RTC will drop\nfrom 16 to 12 when it's done.\nThe RTC busy flag timing needs to be refined with more hardware tests,\nthere's a slim chance of the game hanging on save at the moment.\n\nThe SPC7110 ALU delays are emulated now, too. They may not be perfectly\naccurate, but they get the basic gist down.\nThe only hack that needs to be removed now is the decompression busy\nflag. That's ... not going to be fun.\n\nI also redid the mouse emulation. I was polling the mouse position\nmultiple times per latch. So it should be a bit more precise now,\nI hope.\nI read it regardless of latch state, dunno if that's good or not."], "commit_time": ["2012-05-16T00:27:34Z"]},

Uses the priority queue as\nwell, so there is zero speed-hit. Given the way range-testing works, the\ntrigger point may vary by 1-2 pixels when firing at the same spot. Not\nreally a big deal when it avoids a massive speed penalty.\nFixed PAL and interlace-mode HVIRQs at V=0,H<2 on the fast CPU core.\nAdded the dot-renderer's sprite list update-on-OAM-write functionality\nto the scanline-based PPU renderer. Unfortunately it looks like all the\nspeed gain was already taken from the global dirty flag I was using\nbefore, but this certainly won't hurt speed any, so whatever.\nAdded #ifdef to stop CoInitialize(0) on non-Windows ports.\nAdded #ifdefs to stop gradient fade on Windows port. Not going to fuck\nover the Linux port aesthetic because of Qt bug #47,326,927. If there's\na way to tell what Qt theme is being used, I can leave it enabled for\nXP/Vista themes.\nMoved HDMA trigger from 1104 to 1112, and reduced channel overhead from\n24 to 16, to better simulate one-cycle DMA->CPU sync.\n\nCode clarity: I've re-added my varint.hpp classes, and am actively using\nthem in the accuracy cores. So far, I haven't done anything that would\ndetriment speed, but it is certainly cool. The APU ports exposed by the\nCPU and SMP now take uint2 address arguments, the CPU WRAM address\nregister is a uint17, and the IRQ H/VTIME values are uint10. This\nbasically allows the source to clearly convey the data sizes, and\neliminates the need to manually mask values when writing to registers or\nreading from memory. I'm going to be doing this everywhere, and it will\nhave a speed impact eventually, because the automation means we can't\nskip masks when we know the data is already masked off.\n\nSource: archive contains the launcher code, so that I can look into why\nit's crashing on XP tomorrow.\n\nIt doesn't look like Circuit USA's flags are going to work too well with\nthis new CPU core. Still not sure what the hell Robocop vs The\nTerminator is doing, I'll read through the mega SNES thread for clues\ntomorrow. Speedy Gonzales is definitely broken, as modifying the MDR was\nbreaking things with my current core. Probably because the new CPU core\ndoesn't wait for a cycle edge to trigger.\n\nI was thinking that perhaps we could keep some form of cheat codes list\nto work as game-specific hacks for the performance core. Keeps the hacks\nout of the emulator, but could allow the remaining bugs to be worked\naround for people who have no choice but to use the performance core."], "commit_time": ["2010-08-16T09:42:20Z"]},

Or maybe even a crash with OpenGL.\nI don't yet have detection code to make sure you have an appropriate\nvisual in place.\n\n30-bit mode will really only work if you are running Linux, running Xorg\nat Depth 30, use the OpenGL or XShm driver, have an nVidia Quadro or AMD\nFireGL card with the official drivers, and have a 30-bit capable\nmonitor.\nLots of planning and work for very little gain here, but it's nice that\nit's finally finished.\n\nOh, I had to change the contrast/brightness formulas a tiny bit, but\nthey still work and look nice."], "commit_time": ["2011-12-03T03:22:54Z"]},

invalid profile or compile on\n  an unsupported platform (instead of hanging forever)\n- added unverified.png to resources (causes too big of a speed hit to\n  actually check for folder/unverified file ... so disabled for now)\n- fixed default browser paths for Game Boy, Sufami Turbo and BS-X\n  Satellaview (have to delete paths.cfg to see this)\n- browser home button seeks to configpath()/higan/library.cfg\n- settings->driver is now settings->advanced, and it adds game library\n  path setting and profile information\n- emulation cores now load manifest files internally, manifest.bml is\n  not required for a game folder to be recognized by higan as such\n- BS-X Satellaview and Sufami Turbo slot cartridge handling moved out of\n  sfc/chip and into sfc/slot\n- Video::StartFullScreen only sets fullscreen when a game is specified\n  on the command-line\n\npurify and ananke changelog:\n- library output path shown in purify window\n- added button to change library path\n- squelch firmware warning windows to prevent multi-threading crash, but\n  only via purify (they show up in higan still)"], "commit_time": ["2013-01-21T12:27:15Z"]},

Can't get any games far enough in to see if\nit actually works. So in other words, it doesn't work at all and is 100%\ncompletely broken.\n\nAlso added 68K exceptions and interrupts. So far only the VDP interrupt\nis present. It definitely seems to be firing in commercial games, so\nthat's promising. But the implementation is almost certainly completely\nwrong. There is fuck all of nothing for documentation on how interrupts\nactually work. I had to find out the interrupt vector numbers from\nreading the comments from the Sonic the Hedgehog disassembly. I have\nliterally no fucking clue what I0-I2 (3-bit integer priority value in\nthe status register) is supposed to do. I know that Vblank=6, Hblank=4,\nExt(gamepad)=2. I know that at reset, SR.I=7. I don't know if I'm\nsupposed to block interrupts when I is >, >=, <, <= to the interrupt\nlevel. I don't know what level CPU exceptions are supposed to be.\n\nAlso implemented VDP regular DMA. No idea if it works correctly since\nnone of the commercial games run far enough to use it. So again, it's\nhorribly broken for usre.\n\nAlso improved VDP fill mode. But I don't understand how it takes\nbyte-lengths when the bus is 16-bit. The transfer times indicate it's\nactually transferring at the same speed as the 68K->VDP copy, strongly\nsuggesting it's actually doing 16-bit transfers at a time. In which case,\nwhat happens when you set an odd transfer length?\n\nAlso, both DMA modes can now target VRAM, VSRAM, CRAM. Supposedly there's\nall kinds of weird shit going on when you target VSRAM, CRAM with VDP\nfill/copy modes, but whatever. Get to that later.\n\nAlso implemented a very lazy preliminary wait mechanism to to stall out\na processor while another processor exerts control over the bus. This\none's going to be a major work in progress. For one, it totally breaks\nthe model I use to do save states with libco. For another, I don't\nknow if a 68K->VDP DMA instantly locks the CPU, or if it the CPU could\nactually keep running if it was executing out of RAM when it started\nthe DMA transfer from ROM (eg it's a bus busy stall, not a hard chip\nstall.) That'll greatly change how I handle the waiting.\n\nAlso, the OSS driver now supports Audio::Latency. Sound should be\neven lower latency now. On FreeBSD when set to 0ms, it's absolutely\nincredible. Cannot detect latency whatsoever. The Mario jump sound seems\nto happen at the very instant I hear my cherry blue keyswitch activate."], "commit_time": ["2016-08-15T04:56:38Z"]},

(Hayazashi Nidan Morita Shougi). The former was already playable\nwith HLE, but lacked timing emulation. The latter has never been\nplayable through emulation before now. But as with SD Gundam GX before,\nyou really weren't missing much.\n\n[...]\n\nAlso new in this release is my own Game Boy emulator. It is being used\nto provide native Super Game Boy support, built directly into bsnes.\nThis core is released under the GPLv2, but I am willing to grant a more\npermissive license for other SNES emulators, if anyone is interested.\n\nOf course I cannot compete with the quality of gambatte, and certainly\nnot from only a weeks' worth of work. Currently, there is no Game\nBoy-side sound output and there are quite a few bugs remaining in its\nemulation core. I would appreciate any help on this, the Game Boy is not\nmy forte. So yes, we are taking a step back today, so that we may take\ntwo steps forward in the future.\n\n[...]\n\nLastly, the debugger is still Linux-only, but it is now stable enough to\nbe considered usable. Check it out if you like, compile with -DDEBUGGER\nto enable it."], "commit_time": ["2011-01-11T10:30:47Z"]},

There are a few important emulation improvements\nand a few new features; but for the most part, this release focuses on\nmajor code refactoring, the details of which I will mostly spare you.\n\nThe major change is that, as of v099, the SNES balanced and performance\ncores have been removed from higan. Basically, in addition to my five\nother emulation cores, these were too much of a burden to maintain. And\nthey've come along as far as I was able to develop them. If you need to\nuse these cores, please use these two from the v098 release.\n\nI'm very well aware that ~80% of the people using higan for SNES\nemulation were using the two removed profiles. But they simply had\nto go. Hopefully in the future, we can compensate for their loss by\nincreasing the performance of the accuracy core.\n\nChangelog (since v098):\n\nSFC: balanced profile removed\nSFC: performance profile removed\nSFC: expansion port devices can now be changed during gameplay (atlhough\n    you shouldn't)\nSFC: fixed bug in SharpRTC leap year calculations\nSFC: emulated new research findings for the S-DD1 coprocessor\nSFC: fixed CPU emulation-mode wrapping bug with pei, [dp], [dp]+y\n    instructions [AWJ]\nSFC: fixed Super Game Boy bug that caused the bottom tile-row to flicker\n    in games\nGB: added MBC1M (multi-cart) mapper; icarus can't detect these so manual\n    manifests are needed for now\nGB: corrected return value when HuC3 unmapped RAM is read; fixes Robopon\n    [endrift]\nGB: improved STAT IRQ emulation; fixes Altered Space, etc [endrift,\n    gekkio]\nGB: partial emulation of DMG STAT write IRQ bug; fixes Legend of Zerd,\n    Road Rash, etc\nnall: execute() fix, for some Linux platforms that had trouble detecting\n    icarus\nnall: new BitField class; which allows for simplifying flag/register\n    emulation in various cores\nruby: added Windows WASAPI audio driver (experimental)\nruby: remove attempts to call glSwapIntervalEXT (fixes crashing on some\n    Linux systems)\nui: timing settings panel removed\nvideo: restored saturation, gamma, luminance settings\nvideo: added new post-emulation sprite system; light gun cursors are\n    now higher-resolution\naudio: new resampler (6th-order Butterworth biquad IIR); quite a bit\n    faster than the old one\naudio: added optional basic reverb filter (for fun)\nhigan: refresh video outside cooperative threads (workaround for shoddy\n    code in AMD graphics drivers)\nhigan: individual emulation cores no longer have unique names\nhigan: really substantial code refactoring; 43% reduction in binary size\n\nOff the bat, here are the known bugs:\n\nhiro/Windows: focus stealing bug on startup. Needs to be fixed in hiro,\n    not with a cheap hack to tomoko.\n\nhigan/SFC: some of the coprocessors are saving some volatile memory to\n    disk. Completely harmless, but still needs to be fixed.\n\nruby/WASAPI: some sound cards have a lot of issues with the current driver\n    (eg FitzRoy's). We need to find a clean way to fix this before it\n    can be made the default driver. Which would be a huge win because\n    the latency improvements are substantial, and in exclusive mode,\n    WASAPI allows G-sync to work very well.\n\n[From the v099 WIP thread, here's the changelog since v098r19:\n\n- GB: don't force mode 1 during force-blank; fixes v098r16 regression\n  with many Game Boy games\n- GB: only perform the STAT write IRQ bug during vblank, not hblank\n  (still not hardware accurate, though)\n\n-Ed.]"], "commit_time": ["2016-06-11T01:13:18Z"]},

After\ncreating new higan and icarus icons, the size jumped to 1090KiB, which\nwas insane for only adding one additional icon.\n\nAfter digging into why, I discovered that ImageMagick defaults to\n64-bit!! (16-bits per channel) PNG images when converting from SVG.\nYou know, for all those 16-bit per channel monitors that don't exist.\nSigh. Amazingly, nobody ever noticed this.\n\nThe logo went from 78.8KiB to 24.5KiB, which in turn also means the\ngenerated resource.cpp shrank dramatically.\n\nThe old higan icon was 32-bit PNG, because it was created before I\ninstalled FreeBSD and switched to ImageMagick. But the new higan icon,\nplus the new icarus icon, were both 64-bit as well. And they're now\n32-bit.\n\nSo the new tarball size, thanks to the logo optimization, dropped to\n830KiB.\n\nCydrak had some really interesting results in converting higan's\nresources to 8-bit palletized PNGs with the tRNS extension for alpha\ntransparency. It reduces the file sizes even more without much visual\nfidelity loss. Eg the higan logo uses 778 colors currently, and 256\nrepresents nearly all of it very well to the human eye. It's based off\nof only two colors, the rest are all anti-aliasing.

Added the\nsrc/fast folder that has all the speed-oriented cores.\n\nA slight slowdown to csnes from what it was before, I'm using blargg's\naccurate DSP. I just don't like the idea of releasing a less accurate\nDSP core than Snes9X v1.52 has. Plus the fast DSP core doesn't serialize\nyet.\n\nI moved back to snes_spc 0.9.0 because I care more about Tales and Star\nOcean than I do about Earthworm Jim 2. So if you try EWJ2 on csnes,\nexpect it to sound like it does on Snes9X. In other words, don't wear\nheadphones if you value your hearing.\n\nThe middle-of-the-road bsnes core uses blargg's accurate DSP, because\nit's about 3% faster than mine which removes all of blargg's\noptimizations. There is absolutely no accuracy loss here. bsnes v067.20\nthat is included should be equal to v067 official.\n\nPerformance:\nCode:\nasnes =  58fps\nbsnes = 172fps +2.97x\ncsnes = 274fps +1.59x +4.72x\n\nThe binaries are not profiled, so that's an additional 15% slower from\nthe previous builds.\n\nSave states only work on asnes, as I don't know how to serialize\nblargg's cores yet. The copy_func thing is very confusing to me for some\nreason. The debugger won't work anywhere.\n\nOutside of that, please go ahead and bug test. Once I get the debugger\nand save states working, I'll build some profiled v1.0 releases for all\nthree, and we can test that for a bit and then release."], "commit_time": ["2010-10-20T11:20:39Z"]},

Windows was the least\nflexible, it only lets you have a check at the start of each item.\nLuckily that's all I need for my purposes so it'll work. It's also a lot\neasier, as now I don't need a ton of extra code to try and set\nper-column checkboxes. Now both Windows and Qt can put text into the\nfirst item with the checkbox, but GTK+ cannot. Further, Qt needs this\nbecause even if you hide the checkbox column, it still tries to search\nfor typed text from the checkbox column. GTK+ does this too, but unlike\nGTK+, Qt lacks an API call to set the search column. Since my code\nbasically has to change this in real-time since you have to call the\nsetProperty functions after create(), this means I always set up the\ncheckbox columns regardless of whether or not they are used. For Qt,\nI had to work around this and it'll be an annoying edge case if you try\nand use setCheckable(true) and then setCheckable(false), because Qt has\nno way to clear the checkboxes from an item once you've enabled them for\nthe first time. But without doing it this way, there's no way for eg the\nROM file loader to allow type-searching, so that's the way I do it.\nWindows works the same, and GTK+ has a separate column (hidden from the\nphoenix API standpoint) for the checkboxes, with no column header label\ntext.\n\nAll in all, a major hassle, but it was the only really major GUI hit\nfrom leaving Qt, aside from the horror that's going to be the debugger,\nwhich needs all kinds of highly specialized controls."], "commit_time": ["2010-10-04T05:33:49Z"]},

As such, I\nwould really appreciate testing as many games as possible ... especially\nthe old finnicky games that had issues with DMA and/or interrupts.\n\nOne thing to note is that I removed an edge case test that suppresses\nIRQs from firing on the very last dot of every field, which is a\nbehavior I've verified on real hardware in the past. I feel that the\nmain interrupt polling function (the hottest portion of the entire\nemulator) is not the appropriate place for it, and I should instead\nfactor it into assignment of NMITIMEN/VTIME/HTIME using the new\nio.irqEnable (==virqEnable||hirqEnable) flag.

here's the deal. I now have three emulators. I don't think the\nNES/GB ones are at all useful, but I do want them to be eventually. And\nhaving them have those pathetic little GUIs like ui-gameboy, and keeping\neverything in separate project folders, just doesn't work well for me.\nI kind of \"got around\" the issue with the Game Boy, by only allowing SGB\nmode emulation. But there is no \"Super Nintendo\" ... er ... wait ...\nuhmm ... well, you know what I mean anyway.\n\nSo, my idea is to write a multi-emulator GUI, and keep the projects\ntogether. The GUI is not going to change much. The way I envision this\nworking:\n\nAt startup, you have a menubar with: \"Cartridge, Settings, Tools, Help\".\nCartridge has \"Load NES Cartridge\", \"Load SNES Cartridge\", etc.\nWhen you load something, Cartridge is replaced with the appropriate\nsystem menu, eg \"SNES\". Here you have all your regular items: \"power,\nreset, controller port selection, etc.\" There is also a new \"Unload\nCartridge\" option, which is how you restore the \"Cartridge\" menu again.\nI have no plans to emulate any other systems, but if I ever do emulate\nsomething that doesn't take cartridges, I'll change the name to just\n\"Load\" or something.\n\nThe cheat editor / state manager will look and act exactly the same. The\nsettings panel will look exactly the same. I'll simply show/hide\nsystem-specific options as needed, like NES/SNES aspect ratio\ncorrection, etc. The input mapping window will just have settings for\nthe currently loaded system. Video and audio tweaking will apply\ncross-system, as will hotkey mapping.\n\nThe GUI stuff is mostly copy-paste, so it should only take me a week to\nget it 95% back to where it was, so don't worry, this isn't total GUI\nrewrite #80.\nI am, however, making all the objects pointers, so that I can destruct\nthem all prior to main() returning, which is certainly one way of fixing\nthat annoying Windows/Qt crash.\n\nPlease only test on Linux. The Windows port is broken to hell, and will\ngive you a bad impression of the idea:\n- menu groups are not hiding for some reason (all groups are showing, it\n  looks hideous)\n- Timer interval(0) is taking 16ms per call, capping the FPS to ~64 tops\n  [FWIW, bsnes/accuracy gets 130fps, bgameboy gets 450fps, bnes gets\n  800fps; all run at lowest possible granularity]\n- the OS keeps beeping when you press keys (AGAIN)\n\nOf course, Qt and GTK+ don't let you shrink a window from the requested\ngeometry size, because they suck. So the video scaling stuff doesn't\nwork all that great yet.\nMan, a metric fuckton of things need to be fixed in phoenix, and\nI really don't know how to fix any of them :/"], "commit_time": ["2011-09-09T04:08:38Z"]},

It now resembles the older snespurify, and\nlets you import multiple game files+archives and regenerate manifests\nfor multiple game folders. It is also recursive.\n\nSo you can now import all of your games for all systems at once, or you\ncan update all of your bsnes v091 game folders to the new higan v092\nformat at once.\n\nCaveats:\n\nFirst, I am now using std::thread, so that the GUI doesn't freeze.\nInstead, you get a nice progress bar. Unfortunately, I was mislead and\nTDM/GCC 4.7 still does not have std::thread support. So ... sorry, but\nI can't compile purify for Windows. I am sick and tired of not being\nable to write multi-threaded code, so fuck it. If anyone can get it to\nbuild on Windows, whether that be by using Windows threads, hacking in\nstd::thread support, skipping threading all together, whatever ...\nthat'll be great. Otherwise, sorry, purify is Linux only until MinGW can\nget its god damned shit together and offers threading support.\n\nSecond, there's no way to regenerate Famicom (NES) manifests, because we\ndiscard the iNES header. We are going to need a database for that. So,\nall I can suggest is that if you use bsnes/higan, keep all your iNES\nimages around to re-import as new releases come out.\n\nThird, when you purify game folders, it will back up the ROM and RAM\nfiles only. Your save states, cheat codes, debug logs, etc will be wiped\nout. There's a whole lot of reasons for this, the most pertinent is that\nit's meant to clean up the folder to a pristine state. It also fixes the\ngame folder name, etc. So ... sorry, but this is how it works. New\nreleases rarely if ever allow old save states to work anyway.\n\nLastly, I am not going to have purify contain infinite backward\ncompatibility for updating manifests. You will want to keep up with\npurifying the collection, otherwise you'll have to grab older purify\ncopies and convert your way along.

On first load, it was\nmapping the expansion port device too late, so it ended up not taking\neffect. I had to spin out the logic for that into\nProgram::connectDevices(). This was proving to be quite annoying while\ntesting eBoot (SNES-Hook simulation.)\n\nSecond, I fixed the audio->set(Frequency, Latency) functions to take\n(uint) parameters from the configuration file, so the weird behavior\naround changing settings in the audio panel should hopefully be gone\nnow.\n\nThird, I rewrote the interface->load,unload functions to call into the\n(Emulator)::System::load,unload functions. And I have those call out to\nCartridge::load,unload. Before, this was inverted, and Cartridge::load()\nwas invoking System::load(), which I felt was kind of backward.\n\nThe Super Game Boy really didn't like this change, however. And it took\nme a few hours to power through it. Before, I had the Game Boy core\ndummying out all the interface->(load,save)Request calls, and having the\nSNES core make them for it. This is because the folder paths and IDs\nwill be different between the two cores.\n\nI've redesigned things so that ICD2's Emulator::Interface overloads\nloadRequest and saveRequest, and translates the requests into new\nrequests for the SuperFamicom core. This allows the Game Boy code to do\nits own loading for everything without a bunch of Super Game Boy special\ncasing, and without any awkwardness around powering on with no cartridge\ninserted.\n\nThis also lets the SNES side of things simply call into higher-level\nGameBoy::interface->load,save(id, stream) functions instead of stabbing\nat the raw underlying state inside of various Game Boy core emulation\nclasses. So things are a lot better abstracted now."], "commit_time": ["2016-02-08T03:17:59Z"]},

If you lower it, color information goes\naway. 0% = grayscale. If you raise it, color intensity increases (and\nclamps.) This is wonderful for GBA games, since they are oversaturated\nto fucking death. Of course we'll want to normalize that inside the\ncore, so the same sat. value works on all systems, but for now it's\nnice. If you raise saturation above 100%, it basically acts like\ncontrast used to. It's just that lowering it fades to grayscale rather\nthan black.\n\nAdding doesn't really work well for brightness, it throws off the\nrelative distance between channels and looks like shit.  So now we have\nluminance, which takes over the old contrast <100% role, and just fades\nthe pixels toward black. Obviously, luminance > 100% would be the same\nas saturation > 100%, so that isn't allowed, it caps at 100% now.\nGamma's the same old function.

years.\n\nI spent four days working 10-16 hours a day reworking layouts in hiro\ncompletely.\n\nThe result is we now have TableLayout, which will allow for better\nhorizontal+vertical combined alignment.\n\nWindows, GTK2, and now GTK3 are fully supported.\n\nWindows is getting the initial window geometry wrong by a bit.\n\nGTK2 and GTK3 work perfectly. I basically abandoned trying to detect\nresize signals, and instead keep a list of all hiro windows that are\nallocated, and every time the main loop runs, it will query all of them\nto see if they've been resized. I'm disgusted that I have to do this,\nbut after fighting with GTK for years, I'm about sick of it. GTK was\ndoing this crazy thing where it would trigger another size-allocate\ninside of a previous size-allocate, and so my layouts would be halfway\nthrough resizing all the widgets, and then the size-allocate would kick\noff another one. That would end up leaving the rest of the first layout\nloop with bad widget sizes. And if I detected a second re-entry and\nblocked it, then the entire window would end up with the older geometry.\nI started trying to build a message queue system to allow the second\nlayout resize to occur after the first one completed, but this was just\ntoo much madness, so I went with the simpler solution.\n\nQt4 has some geometry problems, and doesn't show tab frame layouts\nproperly yet.\n\nQt5 causes an ICE error and tanks my entire Xorg display server, so ...\nsomething is seriously wrong there, and it's not hiro's fault. Creating\na dummy Qt5 application without even using hiro, just int main() {\nTestObject object; } with object performing a dynamic\\_cast to a derived\ntype segfaults. Memory is getting corrupted where GCC allocates the\nvtables for classes, just by linking in Qt. Could be somehow related to\nthe -fPIC requirement that only Qt5 has ... could just be that FreeBSD\n10.1 has a buggy implementation of Qt5. I don't know. It's beyond my\nability to debug, so this one's going to stay broken.\n\nThe Cocoa port is busted. I'll fix it up to compile again, but that's\nabout all I'm going to do.\n\nMany optimizations mean bsnes and higan open faster. GTK2 and GTK3 both\nresize windows very quickly now.\n\nhigan crashes when you load a game, so that's not good. bsnes works\nthough.\n\nbsnes also has the start of a localization engine now. Still a long way\nto go.\n\nThe makefiles received a rather substantial restructuring. Including the\nruby and hiro makefiles will add the necessary compilation rules for\nyou, which also means that moc will run for the qt4 and qt5 targets, and\nwindres will run for the Windows targets."], "commit_time": ["2018-07-14T03:59:29Z"]},

It's functionally\nidentical to bsnes/Qt, 100% of the way. But when you save slots, it\nstores them in RAM. It only writes the BSA archive upon ROM unload\n/ program exit. Yes, this means that technically if the emulator\ncrashes, you'll lose your states. But a) that very rarely happens, and\nb) the old way was thrashing the disk like crazy, every letter you typed\ndumped up to 8MB to disk. With this new method, I can simply store\na boolean valid flag before each slot, and pack the file better. Before,\na save on only slot 3 would be 3*state size (~1.2mb), it will now be\n3bytes+state size (~400kb.) I have also added a proper signature because\nof this, so it will detect when you load an archive for a previous\nserializer version and ignore it. When you go to save (unload the game),\nif there are no valid slots, the BSA archive gets unlinked (deleted.)\n\nI am also planning a feature around the now-hidden \"slot 0\". My idea is\nfor it to be a fallback slot. How many times have you loaded a state\nwhen you meant to save and said, \"shit, now I lost some of my progress\"?\nThe idea is that whenever you load a state, right before loading, it\nwill save to slot 0. When you unload the game, or exit the emulator, it\nwill also save to slot 0. You will be able to load from slot 0 from the\nmenu, but not save to it. It will appear at the bottom of the load list.\nAnd lastly, I'll add an advanced option to auto-load slot 0 if it\nexists, which will enable \"close the emulator and restart where you left\noff.\" functionality."], "commit_time": ["2010-09-30T10:29:49Z"]},

And not in\na good way.\n\n* target-higan and target-loki have been blown away completely\n* nall and ruby massively updated\n* phoenix replaced with hiro (pretty near a total rewrite)\n* target-higan restarted using hiro (just a window for now)\n* all emulation cores updated to compile again\n* installation changed to not require root privileges (installs locally)\n\nFor the foreseeable future (maybe even permanently?), the new higan UI\nwill only build under Linux/BSD with GTK+ 2.20+. Probably the most\nlikely route for Windows/OS X will be to try and figure out how to build\nhiro/GTK on those platforms, as awful as that would be. The other\nalternative would be to produce new UIs for those platforms ... which\nwould actually be a good opportunity to make something much more user\nfriendly.\n\nBeing that I just started on this a few hours ago, that means that for\nat least a few weeks, don't expect to be able to actually play any\ngames. Right now, you can pretty much just compile the binary and that's\nit. It's quite possible that some nall changes didn't produce\ncompilation errors, but will produce runtime errors. So until the UI can\nactually load games, we won't know if anything is broken. But we should\nmostly be okay. It was mostly just trim<1> -> trim changes, moving to\nHash::SHA256 (much cleaner), and patching some reckless memory copy\nfunctions enough to compile.\n\nProgress isn't going to be like it was before: I'm now dividing my time\nmuch thinner between studying and other hobbies.\n\nMy aim this time is not to produce a binary for everyone to play games\non. Rather, it's to keep the emulator alive. I want to be able to apply\ncritical patches again. And I would also like the base of the emulator\nto live on, for use in other emulator frontends that utilize higan."], "commit_time": ["2015-02-26T10:10:46Z"]},

FreeBSD stability and compilation is\nstill a work in progress.\n\nFreeBSD 10 + Clang 3.3 = 108fps\nFreeBSD 10 + GCC 4.7 = 130fps\n\nErrata 1: I've been fighting that god-damned endian.h header for the\npast nine WIPs now. The above WIP isn't building now because FreeBSD\nisn't including headers before using certain types, and you end up with\na trillion error messages. So just delete all the endian.h includes from\nnall/intrinsics.hpp to build.\n\nErrata 2: I was trying to match g++ and g++47, so I used $(findstring\ng++,$(compiler)), which ends up also matching clang++. Oops. Easy fix,\nput Clang first and then else if g++ next. Not ideal, but oh well. All\nit's doing for now is declaring -fwrapv twice, so you don't have to fix\nit just yet. Probably just going to alias g++=\"g++47\" and do exact\nmatching instead.\n\nErrata 3: both OpenGL::term and VideoGLX::term are causing a core dump\non BSD. No idea why. The resources are initialized and valid, but\nreleasing them crashes the application.\n\nChangelog:\n- nall/Makefile is more flexible with overriding $(compiler), so you can\n  build with GCC or Clang on BSD (defaults to GCC now)\n- PLATFORM_X was renamed to PLATFORM_XORG, and it's also declared with\n  PLATFORM_LINUX or PLATFORM_BSD\n  - PLATFORM_XORG probably isn't the best name ... still thinking about\n    what best to call LINUX|BSD|SOLARIS or ^(WINDOWS|MACOSX)\n- fixed a few legitimate Clang warning messages in nall\n- Compiler::VisualCPP is ugly as hell, renamed to Compiler::CL\n- nall/platform includes nall/intrinsics first. Trying to move away from\n  testing for _WIN32, etc directly in all files. Work in progress.\n- nall turns off Clang warnings that I won't \"fix\", because they aren't\n  broken. It's much less noisy to compile with warnings on now.\n- phoenix gains the ability to set background and foreground colors on\n  various text container widgets (GTK only for now.)\n- rewrote a lot of the MSU1 code to try and simplify it. Really hope\n  I didn't break anything ... I don't have any MSU1 test ROMs handy\n- SNES coprocessor audio is now mixed as sclamp<16>(system_sample\n  + coprocessor_sample) instead of sclamp<16>((sys + cop) / 2)\n  - allows for greater chance of aliasing (still low, SNES audio is\n    quiet), but doesn't cut base system volume in half anymore\n- fixed Super Scope and Justifier cursor colors\n- use input.xlib instead of input.x ... allows Xlib input driver to be\n  visible on Linux and BSD once again\n- make install and make uninstall must be run as root again; no longer\n  using install but cp instead for BSD compatibility\n- killed $(DESTDIR) ... use make prefix=$DESTDIR$prefix instead\n- you can now set text/background colors for the loki console via (eg):\n - settings.terminal.background-color 0x000000\n - settings.terminal.foreground-color 0xffffff"], "commit_time": ["2014-02-24T09:39:09Z"]},

One still can't render the start of the\nnext scanline onto the current scanline through overly aggressive\ntimings, but it shouldn't be too much more difficult to allow that to\noccur now. This process incurs quite a major speed hit, so low-end\nsystems with Atom CPUs can't run things at 60fps anymore.\n\nThe timing needs a lot of work. The pixels end up very jagged if the VCE\ndoesn't output batches of 2-4 pixels at a time. But this should not be a\nrequirement at all, so I'm not sure what's going wrong there.\n\nYo, Bro and the 512-width mode of TV Sports Basketball is now broken as\na result of these changes, and I'm not sure why.\n\nTo load SuperGrafx games, you're going to have to change the .pce\nextensions to .sg or .sgx. Or you can manually move the games from the\nPC Engine folder to the SuperGrafx folder and change the game folder\nextensions. I have no way to tell the games apart. Mednafen uses CRC32\ncomparisons, and I may consider that since there's only five games, but\nI'm not sure yet.\n\nThe only SuperGrafx game that's playable right now is Aldynes. And the\npriorities are all screwed up. I don't understand how the windows or the\npriorities work at all from sgxtech.txt, so ... yeah. It's pretty\nbroken, but it's a start.\n\nI could really use some help with this, as I'm very lost right now with\nrendering :/\n\n-----\n\nNote that the SuperGrafx is technically its own system, it's not an\nadd-on.\n\nAs such, I'm giving it a separate .sys folder, and a separate library.\n\nThere's debate over how to name this thing. \"SuperGrafx\" appears more\npopular than \"Super Grafx\".

As this was the final unsupported\nSNES coprocessor, this means that bsnes v087 is the first SNES emulator\nto be able to claim 100% known compatibility with all officially\nreleased games. And it does this with absolutely no hacks.\n\nAgain, I really have to stress the word known. No emulator is perfect.\nNo emulator ever really can be perfect for a system of this complexity.\nThe concept doesn't even really exist, since every SNES behaves subtly\ndifferent. What I mean by this, is that every single game ever\nofficially sold has been tested, and zero bugs (of any severity level)\nare currently known.\n\nIt is of course extremely likely that bugs will be found in this\nrelease, as well as in future releases. But this will always be\na problem for every emulator ever made: there is no way to test every\npossible codepath of every single game to guarantee perfection. I will,\nof course, continue to do my best to fix newfound bugs so long as I'm\naround.\n\nI'd really like to thank Cydrak and LostTemplar for their assistance in\nemulating the ST018. I could not have done it without their help.\n\nThe ST018 ROM, like the other coprocessor ROMs, is copyrighted. This\nmeans I am unable to distribute the image.\n\nChangelog (since v086):\n- emulated the 21.47MHz ST018 (ARMv3) coprocessor used by Hayazashi\n  Nidan Morita Shougi 2\n- fixed PPU TM/TS edge case; fixes bottom scanline of text boxes in\n  Moryo Senki Madara 2\n- fixed saving and loading of Super Game Boy save RAM\n- NEC uPD7725,96050 ROMs now stored in little-endian format for\n  consistency\n- cartridge folder concept has been reworked to use fixed file names\n- added emulation of serial USART interface (replaces asynchronous UART\n  support previously)"], "commit_time": ["2012-03-07T13:29:38Z"]},

Load->System->Enter restarts your\nlast game.\nThat sounds really simple and obvious, but it makes an -incredible-\ndifference. Didn't realize it until I tried an implementation of it,\nwow.\n\nThe input mapping list now lets you bind as many hotkeys as you want to\nany given input.\nSo SFC::Port1::Joypad::B = Keyboard::Z or Joypad::Button1 ... no need to\nremap everything to switch between keyboard and joypad. Either one\nactivates the key.\nThere is a separate Hotkeys tab now. This should hopefully end the\nconfusion about how to remap hotkeys that users experience.\nHotkeys are different, too. Instead of OR logic, they use AND logic.\nSo Fullscreen = Keyboard::Alt and Keyboard::Enter. Both must be pressed\nto enter the key. This lets you easily implement \"super\" modifier keys.\n\nThe actual codebase has new features the old UI never had, and has about\n~50% of the old functionality (so far, of course), yet is only ~25% as\nmuch code.\nThe entire GUI no longer needs to pull in all the headers for each\nemulated system.

caved on the `samples[] = {0.0}` thing, but I'm very unhappy about it\n      - if it's really invalid C++, then GCC needs to stop accepting it\n        in strict `-std=c++14` mode\n  - Emulator::Interface::Information::resettable is gone\n  - Emulator::Interface::reset() is gone\n  - FC, SFC, MD cores updated to remove soft reset behavior\n  - split GameBoy::Interface into GameBoyInterface,\n    GameBoyColorInterface\n  - split WonderSwan::Interface into WonderSwanInterface,\n    WonderSwanColorInterface\n  - PCE: fixed off-by-one scanline error [hex_usr]\n  - PCE: temporary hack to prevent crashing when VDS is set to < 2\n  - hiro: Cocoa: removed (u)int(#) constants; converted (u)int(#)\n    types to (u)int_(#)t types\n  - icarus: replaced usage of unique with strip instead (so we don't\n    mess up frameworks on macOS)\n  - libco: added macOS-specific section marker [Ryphecha]\n\nSo ... the major news this time is the removal of the soft reset\nbehavior. This is a major!! change that results in a 100KiB diff file,\nand it's very prone to accidental mistakes!! If anyone is up for\ntesting, or even better -- looking over the code changes between v102r01\nand v102r02 and looking for any issues, please do so. Ideally we'll want\nto test every NES mapper type and every SNES coprocessor type by loading\nsaid games and power cycling to make sure the games are all cleanly\nresetting. It's too big of a change for me to cover there not being any\nissues on my own, but this is truly critical code, so yeah ... please\nhelp if you can.\n\nWe technically lose a bit of hardware documentation here. The soft reset\nevents do all kinds of interesting things in all kinds of different\nchips -- or at least they do on the SNES. This is obviously not ideal.\nBut in the process of removing these portions of code, I found a few\nmistakes I had made previously. It simplifies resetting the system state\na lot when not trying to have all the power() functions call the reset()\nfunctions to share partial functionality.\n\nIn the future, the goal will be to come up with a way to add back in the\nsoft reset behavior via keyboard binding as with the Master System core.\nWhat's going to have to happen is that the key binding will have to send\na \"reset pulse\" to every emulated chip, and those chips are going to\nhave to act independently to power() instead of reusing functionality.\nWe'll get there eventually, but there's many things of vastly greater\nimportance to work on right now, so it'll be a while. The information\nisn't lost ... we'll just have to pull it out of v102 when we are ready.\n\nNote that I left the SNES reset vector simulation code in, even though\nit's not possible to trigger, for the time being.\n\nAlso ... the Super Game Boy core is still disconnected. To be honest, it\ntotally slipped my mind when I released v102 that it wasn't connected\nagain yet. This one's going to be pretty tricky to be honest. I'm\nthinking about making a third GameBoy::Interface class just for SGB, and\ncoming up with some way of bypassing platform-> calls when in this\nmode."], "commit_time": ["2017-01-22T21:04:26Z"]},

I wanted to test out nall::chrono, and I was also\nthinking that by polling every emulated frame, it's pretty wasteful when\nyou are using Fast Forward and hitting 200+fps. As I've said before,\ncalls to ruby::input::poll are not cheap.\n\nSo to get around this, I added a limiter so that if you called the\nhardware poll function within N milliseconds, it'll return without\ndoing any actual work. And indeed, that increases my framerate of Zelda\n3 uncapped from 133fps to 142fps. Yay. But it's not a \"real\" speedup,\nas it only helps you when you exceed 100% speed (theoretically, you'd\nneed to crack 300% speed since the game itself will poll at 16ms at 100%\nspeed, but yet it sped up Zelda 3, so who am I to complain?)\n\nI threw the latency value into the settings file. It should be 16,\nbut I set it to 5 since that was the lowest before it started negatively\nimpacting uncapped speeds. You're wasting your time and CPU cycles setting\nit lower than 5, but if people like placebo effects it might work. Maybe\nI should let it be a signed integer so people can set it to -16 and think\nit's actually faster :P (I'm only joking. I took out the 96000hz audio\nplacebo effect as well. Not really into psychological tricks anymore.)\n\nBut yeah seriously, I didn't do this to start this discussion again for\nthe billionth time. Please don't go there. And please don't tell me this\nWIP has higher/lower latency than before. I don't want to hear it.\n\nThe only reason I bring it up is for the fun part that is worth\ndiscussing: put up or shut up time on how sensitive you are to\nlatency! You can set the value above 5 to see how games feel.\n\nI personally can't really tell a difference until about 50. And I can't\nbe 100% confident it's worse until about 75. But ... when I set it to\n150, games become \"extra difficult\" ... the higher it goes, the worse\nit gets :D\n\nFor this WIP, I've left no upper limit cap. I'll probably set a cap of\nsomething like 500ms or 1000ms for the official release. Need to balance\nuser error/trolling with enjoyability. I'll think about it.\n\n[...]\n\nNow, what I worry about is stupid people seeing it and thinking it's an\n\"added latency\" setting, as if anyone would intentionally make things\nworse by default. This is a limiter. So if 5ms have passed since the\ngame last polled, and that will be the case 99.9% of the time in games,\nthe next poll will happen just in time, immediately when the game polls\nthe inputs. Thus, a value below 1/<framerate>ms is not only pointless,\nif you go too low it will ruin your fast forward max speeds.\n\nI did say I didn't want to resort to placebo tricks, but I also don't\nwant to spark up public discussion on this again either. So it might\nbe best to default Input/Latency to 0ms, and internally have a max(5,\nlatency) wrapper around the value."], "commit_time": ["2016-08-03T12:32:40Z"]},

I've always\nreally wanted lots of fun controls to customize audio, and now finally\nwith this new biquad filter, I can finally start implementing real\neffects. For instance, an equalizer wouldn't be too complicated anymore.\n\nThe new reverb effect is still a poor man's version. I need to find human\nreadable source for implementing a comb-filter properly. I'm pretty sure\nI can already treat nall::queue as an all-pass filter since all that\ndoes is phase shift (fancy audio term for \"delay audio\"). What's really\ngoing to be hard is figuring out how to expose user-friendly settings for\ncontrolling it. It looks like you need a bunch of coprime coefficients,\nand I don't think casual users are going to be able to hand-enter coprime\nvalues to get the echo effect they want. I uh ... don't even know how\nto calculate coprime values dynamically right now >_> But we're going\nto have to, as they are correlated to the output sampling rate.\n\nWe'll definitely want to make some audio profiles so that users can\nquickly select pre-configured themes that sound nice, but expose the\nunderlying coefficients so that they can tweak stuff to their liking. This\nisn't just about higan, this is about me trying to learn digital signal\nprocessing, so please don't be too upset about feature creep or anything\non this.\n\nAnyway ... I'm having some difficulties with my audio right now. When\nthe reverb effect is enabled, there's a bunch of static on system\nreset for just a moment. But this should not be possible. nall::queue\nis initializing all previous reverb sample elements to 0.0. I don't\nunderstand where static is coming in from. Further, we have the same\nissue with both the windowed sinc and the biquad filters ... a bit of\na popping sound when starting a game. Any help tracking this down would\nbe appreciated.\n\nThere's also one really annoying issue ... I can't seem to do reverb\nor volume adjustments with normalized samples. If I say \"volume *= 0.5\"\nin higan/audio/audio.cpp line 68, it doesn't just halve the volume, it\nadds a whole bunch of distortion. This makes absolutely zero sense to\nme. The sample values are between 0.0 (mute) and 1.0 (full volume) here,\nso multiplying a double by 0.5 shouldn't cause distortion. So right now,\nI'm doing these adjustments with less precision after denormalizing back\nto int16. Anyone ever see something like that? :/"], "commit_time": ["2016-05-31T22:29:36Z"]},

\"File->Load Game\" moved to \"Load->Import Game\" ... may cause a bit of\n  confusion to new users, but I don't like having a single-item menu,\n  we'll just have to explain it to new users\n- browser window redone to look like ananke\n  - home button here goes to ~/Emulation rather than just ~ like ananke,\n    since this is the home of game folders\n  - game folder icon is now the executable icon for the Tango theme\n    (orange diamond), meant to represent a complete game rather than\n    a game file or archive\n\nananke changelog:\n- outputs GBC games to \"Game Boy Color/\" instead of \"Game Boy/\"\n- adds the file basename to \"information/title\"\n\nKnown issues:\n- using ananke to load a GB game trips the Super Famicom SGB mode and\n  fails (need to make the full-path auto-detection ignore non-bootable\n  systems)\n- need to dump and test some BS-X media before releasing\n- ananke lacks BS-X Satellaview cartridge support\n- v092 isn't going to let you retarget the

Longer explanation of why here:\n", "\n\nAgain, we really need to test this as thoroughly as possible for\nregressions :/\nThis is a really major change that affects absolutely everything: all\nemulation cores, all coprocessors, etc.\n\nAlso added ADDX and SUB to the 68K core, which brings us just barely\nabove 50% of the instruction encoding space completed.\n\n[Editor's note: The \"aformentioned scheduler changes\" were described in\na previous forum post:\n\n    Unfortunately, 64-bits just wasn't enough precision (we were\n    getting misalignments ~230 times a second on 21/24MHz clocks), so\n    I had to move to 128-bit counters. This of course doesn't exist on\n    32-bit architectures (and probably not on all 64-bit ones either),\n    so for now ... higan's only going to compile on 64-bit machines\n    until we figure something out. Maybe we offer a \"lower precision\"\n    fallback for machines that lack uint128_t or something. Using the\n    booth algorithm would be way too slow.\n\n    Anyway, the precision is now 2^-96, which is roughly 10^-29. That\n    puts us far beyond the yoctosecond. Suck it, MAME :P I'm jokingly\n    referring to it as the byuusecond. The other 32-bits of precision\n    allows a 1Hz clock to run up to one full second before all clocks\n    need to be normalized to prevent overflow.\n\n    I fixed a serious wobbling issue where I was using clock > other.clock\n    for synchronization instead of clock >= other.clock; and also another\n    aliasing issue when two threads share a common frequency, but don't\n    run in lock-step. The latter I don't even fully understand, but I\n    did observe it in testing.\n\n    nall/serialization.hpp has been extended to support 128-bit integers,\n    but without explicitly naming them (yay generic code), so nall will\n    still compile on 32-bit platforms for all other applications.\n\n    Speed is basically a wash now. FC's a bit slower, SFC's a bit faster.\n\nThe \"longer explanation\" in the linked hastebin is:\n\n    Okay, so the idea is that we can have an arbitrary number of\n    oscillators. Take the SNES:\n\n    - CPU/PPU clock = 21477272.727272hz\n    - SMP/DSP clock = 24576000hz\n    - Cartridge DSP1 clock = 8000000hz\n    - Cartridge MSU1 clock = 44100hz\n    - Controller Port 1 modem controller clock = 57600hz\n    - Controller Port 2 barcode battler clock = 115200hz\n    - Expansion Port exercise bike clock = 192000hz\n\n    Is this a pathological case? Of course it is, but it's possible. The\n    first four do exist in the wild already: see Rockman X2 MSU1\n    patch. Manifest files with higan let you specify any frequency you\n    want for any component.\n\n    The old trick higan used was to hold an int64 counter for each\n    thread:thread synchronization, and adjust it like so:\n\n    - if thread A steps X clocks; then clock += X * threadB.frequency\n      - if clock >= 0; switch to threadB\n    - if thread B steps X clocks; then clock -= X * threadA.frequency\n      - if clock <  0; switch to threadA\n\n    But there are also system configurations where one processor has to\n    synchronize with more than one other processor. Take the Genesis:\n\n    - the 68K has to sync with the Z80 and PSG and YM2612 and VDP\n    - the Z80 has to sync with the 68K and PSG and YM2612\n    - the PSG has to sync with the 68K and Z80 and YM2612\n\n    Now I could do this by having an int64 clock value for every\n    association. But these clock values would have to be outside the\n    individual Thread class objects, and we would have to update every\n    relationship's clock value. So the 68K would have to update the Z80,\n    PSG, YM2612 and VDP clocks. That's four expensive 64-bit multiply-adds\n    per clock step event instead of one.\n\n    As such, we have to account for both possibilities. The only way to\n    do this is with a single time base. We do this like so:\n\n    - setup: scalar = timeBase / frequency\n    - step: clock += scalar * clocks\n\n    Once per second, we look at every thread, find the smallest clock\n    value. Then subtract that value from all threads. This prevents the\n    clock counters from overflowing.\n\n    Unfortunately, these oscillator values are psychotic, unpredictable,\n    and often times repeating fractions. Even with a timeBase of\n    1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one attosecond); we get rounding errors\n    every ~16,300 synchronizations. Specifically, this happens with a CPU\n    running at 21477273hz (rounded) and SMP running at 24576000hz. That\n    may be good enough for most emulators, but ... you know how I am.\n\n    Plus, even at the attosecond level, we're really pushing against the\n    limits of 64-bit integers. Given the reciprocal inverse, a frequency\n    of 1Hz (which does exist in higan!) would have a scalar that consumes\n    1/18th of the entire range of a uint64 on every single step. Yes, I\n    could raise the frequency, and then step by that amount, I know. But\n    I don't want to have weird gotchas like that in the scheduler core.\n\n    Until I increase the accuracy to about 100 times greater than a\n    yoctosecond, the rounding errors are too great. And since the only\n    choice above 64-bit values is 128-bit values; we might as well use\n    all the extra headroom. 2^-96 as a timebase gives me the ability to\n    have both a 1Hz and 4GHz clock; and run them both for a full second;\n    before an overflow event would occur.\n\nAnother hastebin includes demonstration code:\n\n    #include <libco/libco.h>\n\n    #include <nall/nall.hpp>\n    using namespace nall;\n\n    //\n\n    cothread_t mainThread = nullptr;\n    const uint iterations = 100'000'000;\n    const uint cpuFreq = 21477272.727272 + 0.5;\n    const uint smpFreq = 24576000.000000 + 0.5;\n    const uint cpuStep = 4;\n    const uint smpStep = 5;\n\n    //\n\n    struct ThreadA {\n      cothread_t handle = nullptr;\n      uint64 frequency = 0;\n      int64 clock = 0;\n\n      auto create(auto (*entrypoint)() -> void, uint frequency) {\n        this->handle = co_create(65536, entrypoint);\n        this->frequency = frequency;\n        this->clock = 0;\n      }\n    };\n\n    struct CPUA : ThreadA {\n      static auto Enter() -> void;\n      auto main() -> void;\n      CPUA() { create(&CPUA::Enter, cpuFreq); }\n    } cpuA;\n\n    struct SMPA : ThreadA {\n      static auto Enter() -> void;\n      auto main() -> void;\n      SMPA() { create(&SMPA::Enter, smpFreq); }\n    } smpA;\n\n    uint8 queueA[iterations];\n    uint offsetA;\n    cothread_t resumeA = cpuA.handle;\n\n    auto EnterA() -> void {\n      offsetA = 0;\n      co_switch(resumeA);\n    }\n\n    auto QueueA(uint value) -> void {\n      queueA[offsetA++] = value;\n      if(offsetA >= iterations) {\n        resumeA = co_active();\n        co_switch(mainThread);\n      }\n    }\n\n    auto CPUA::Enter() -> void { while(true) cpuA.main(); }\n\n    auto CPUA::main() -> void {\n      QueueA(1);\n      smpA.clock -= cpuStep * smpA.frequency;\n      if(smpA.clock < 0) co_switch(smpA.handle);\n    }\n\n    auto SMPA::Enter() -> void { while(true) smpA.main(); }\n\n    auto SMPA::main() -> void {\n      QueueA(2);\n      smpA.clock += smpStep * cpuA.frequency;\n      if(smpA.clock >= 0) co_switch(cpuA.handle);\n    }\n\n    //\n\n    struct ThreadB {\n      cothread_t handle = nullptr;\n      uint128_t scalar = 0;\n      uint128_t clock = 0;\n\n      auto print128(uint128_t value) {\n        string s;\n        while(value) {\n          s.append((char)('0' + value % 10));\n          value /= 10;\n        }\n        s.reverse();\n        print(s, \"\\n\");\n      }\n\n      //femtosecond (10^15) =    16306\n      //attosecond  (10^18) =   688838\n      //zeptosecond (10^21) = 13712691\n      //yoctosecond (10^24) = 13712691 (hitting a dead-end on a rounding error causing a wobble)\n      //byuusecond?

CPU is both a processor and\nthe main bus (ROM, RAM, WRAM, etc), APU is the shared memory by the\nSMP+DSP (eg use it to catch writes from either chip); PPU probably won't\never be used since it's broken down into three separate buses (VRAM,\nOAM, CGRAM), but DSP could be useful for tracking bugs like we found in\nKoushien 2 with the DSP echo buffer corrupting SMP opcodes.

These cores do not yet offer sound emulation, save\nstates or cheat codes.\n\nI'm always very hesitant to release a new emulation core in its alpha\nstages, as in the past this has resulted in lasting bad impressions\nof cores that have since improved greatly. For instance, the Game Boy\nAdvance emulation offered today is easily the second most accurate around,\nyet it is still widely judged by its much older alpha implementation.\n\nHowever, it's always been tradition with higan to not hold onto code\nin secret. Rather than delay future releases for another year or two,\nI'll put my faith in you all to understand that the emulation of these\nsystems will improve over time.\n\nI hope that by releasing things as they are now, I might be able to\nreceive some much needed assistance in improving these cores, as the\ndocumentation for these new systems is very much less than ideal.\n\nbyuu says (in the WIP forum):\n\nChangelog:\n\n  - PCE: latch background scroll registers (fixes Neutopia scrolling)\n  - PCE: clip background attribute table scrolling (fixes Blazing Lazers\n    scrolling)\n  - PCE: support background/sprite enable/disable bits\n  - PCE: fix large sprite indexing (fixes Blazing Lazers title screen\n    sprites)\n  - HuC6280: wrap zeropage accesses to never go beyond $20xx\n  - HuC6280: fix alternating addresses for block move instructions\n    (fixes Neutopia II)\n  - HuC6280: block move instructions save and restore A,X,Y registers\n  - HuC6280: emulate BCD mode (may not be 100% correct, based on SNES\n    BCD) (fixes Blazing Lazers scoring)"], "commit_time": ["2017-01-19T21:01:15Z"]},

modifications)\n\nI would really appreciate extensive regression testing (especially\naround SuperFX, Cx4, ST018, DSP-n, ST-01n, NES, GB) at this point.\nThe most critical core changes should be completed now. And it was an\nunbelievable amount of restructuring.\n\nChangelog:\n- SuperFX core moved to Processor::GSU\n- SNES::CPU core moved to Processor::R65816\n- SNES::SMP core moved to Processor::SPC700\n- NES::CPU core renamed to Processor::R6502\n- use filestream to load RAM files from interface\n- save states store SHA256 instead of CRC32 (CRC32 usage removed\n  entirely from bsnes)\n- nes/ -> fc/ and NES -> FC\n- snes/ -> sfc/ and SNES -> SFC\n- SuperFamicom::MappedRAM::copy uses stream instead of data+size\n- Linux port uses gcc-4.7 (still using only gcc-4.6 subset, so you can\n  make a gcc-4.6 symlink for now if you like.)\n- all profiles and all targets compile and work properly\n\nAll eight instruction set cores have been moved to processor/ now.\nConsistency's a wonderful thing.\nThe last remnants of NES/SNES are now limited to target-ui code; and the\nnall/(system) folder names.\nI'm building with gcc-4.7 on my Linux box now because the resultant\nbinaries are up to 20% faster (seriously) than gcc-4.6."], "commit_time": ["2012-04-29T06:16:44Z"]},

My next step is to\nwrite up hiro API documentation, and move the API from alpha (constantly\nchanging) to beta (rarely changing), in preparation for the first stable\nrelease (backward-compatible changes only.)\n\nAdded \"--fullscreen\" command-line option. I like this over\na configuration file option. Lets you use the emulator in both modes\nwithout having to modify the config file each time.\n\nAlso enhanced the command-line game loading. You can now use any of\nthese methods:\n\n    higan /path/to/game-folder.sfc\n    higan /path/to/game-folder.sfc/\n    higan /path/to/game-folder.sfc/program.rom\n\nThe idea is to support launchers that insist on loading files only.\n\nTechnically, the file can be any name (manifest.bml also works); the\nonly criteria is that the file actually exists and is a file, and not\na directory. This is a requirement to support the first version (a\ndirectory lacking the trailing / identifier), because I don't want my\nnall::string class to query the file system to determine if the string\nis an actual existing file or directory for its pathname() / dirname()\nfunctions.\n\nAnyway, every game folder I've made so far has program.rom, and that's\nvery unlikely to change, so this should be fine.\n\nNow, of course, if you drop a regular \"game.sfc\" file on the emulator,\nit won't even try to load it, unless it's in a folder that ends in .fc,\n.sfc, etc. In which case, it'll bail out immediately by being unable to\nproduce a manifest for what is obviously not really a game folder."], "commit_time": ["2015-08-30T02:08:26Z"]},

I'll\nfix it in the next WIP.)\n\nI completely replaced the time management system in higan and overhauled\nthe scheduler.\n\nBefore, processor threads would have \"int64 clock\"; and there would\nbe a 1:1 relationship between two threads. When thread A ran for X\ncycles, it'd subtract X * B.Frequency from clock; and when thread B ran\nfor Y cycles, it'd add Y * A.Frequency from clock. This worked well\nand allowed perfect precision; but it doesn't work when you have more\ncomplicated relationships: eg the 68K can sync to the Z80 and PSG; the\nZ80 to the 68K and PSG; so the PSG needs two counters.\n\nThe new system instead uses a \"uint64 clock\" variable that represents\ntime in attoseconds. Every time the scheduler exits, it subtracts\nthe smallest clock count from all threads, to prevent an overflow\nscenario. The only real downside is that rounding errors mean that\nroughly every 20 minutes, we have a rounding error of one clock cycle\n(one 20,000,000th of a second.) However, this only applies to systems\nwith multiple oscillators, like the SNES. And when you're in that\nsituation ... there's no such thing as a perfect oscillator anyway. A\nreal SNES will be thousands of times less out of spec than 1hz per 20\nminutes.\n\nThe advantages are pretty immense. First, we obviously can now support\nmore complex relationships between threads. Second, we can build a\nmuch more abstracted scheduler. All of libco is now abstracted away\ncompletely, which may permit a state-machine / coroutine version of\nThread in the future. We've basically gone from this:\n\n    auto SMP::step(uint clocks) -> void {\n      clock += clocks * (uint64)cpu.frequency;\n      dsp.clock -= clocks;\n      if(dsp.clock < 0 && !scheduler.synchronizing()) co_switch(dsp.thread);\n      if(clock >= 0 && !scheduler.synchronizing()) co_switch(cpu.thread);\n    }\n\nTo this:\n\n    auto SMP::step(uint clocks) -> void {\n      Thread::step(clocks);\n      synchronize(dsp);\n      synchronize(cpu);\n    }\n\nAs you can see, we don't have to do multiple clock adjustments anymore.\nThis is a huge win for the SNES CPU that had to update the SMP, DSP, all\nperipherals and all coprocessors. Likewise, we don't have to synchronize\nall coprocessors when one runs, now we can just synchronize the active\none to the CPU.\n\nThird, when changing the frequencies of threads (think SGB speed setting\nmodes, GBC double-speed mode, etc), it no longer causes the \"int64\nclock\" value to be erroneous.\n\nFourth, this results in a fairly decent speedup, mostly across the\nboard. Aside from the GBA being mostly a wash (for unknown reasons),\nit's about an 8% - 12% speedup in every other emulation core.\n\nNow, all of this said ... this was an unbelievably massive change, so\n... you know what that means >_> If anyone can help test all types of\nSNES coprocessors, and some other system games, it'd be appreciated.\n\n----\n\nLastly, we have a bitchin' new about screen. It unfortunately adds\n~200KiB onto the binary size, because the PNG->C++ header file\ntransformation doesn't compress very well, and I want to keep the\noriginal resource files in with the higan archive. I might try some\nthings to work around this file size increase in the future, but for now\n... yeah, slightly larger archive sizes, sorry.\n\nThe logo's a bit busted on Windows (the Label control's background\ntransparency and alignment settings aren't working), but works well on\nGTK. I'll have to fix Windows before the next official release. For now,\nlook on my Twitter feed if you want to see what it's supposed to look\nlike.\n\n----\n\nEDIT: forgot about ICD2::Enter. It's doing some weird inverse\nrun-to-save thing that I need to implement support for somehow. So, save\nstates on the SGB core probably won't work with this WIP."], "commit_time": ["2016-07-30T03:56:12Z"]},

release/\nis not guaranteed to be finalized just yet), removes the database\nintegration, and adds support for ananke.\n\nananke represents inevitability. It's a library that, when installed,\nhigan can use to load files from the command-line, and also from a new\nFile -> Load Game menu option.\n\nI need to change the build rules a bit for it to work on Windows (need\nto make phoenix a DLL, basically), but it works now on Linux.\n\nRight now, it only takes *.sfc file names, looks them up in the included\ndatabase, converts them to game folders, and returns the game folder\npath for higan to load.\n\nThe idea is to continue expanding it to support everything we can that\nI don't want in the higan core:\n- load *.sfc, *.smc, *.swc, *.fig files\n- remove SNES copier headers\n- split apart merged firmware files\n- pull in external firmware files (eg dsp1b.rom - these are staying\n  merged, just as SPC7110 prg+dat are merged)\n- load *.zip and *.7z archives\n- prompt for selection on multi-file archives\n- generate manifest files based on heuristics\n- apply BPS patches\n\nThe \"Load\" menu option has been renamed to \"Library\", to represent games\nin your library. I'm going to add some sort of suffix to indicate\nunverified games, and use a different folder icon for those (eg\nmanifests built on heuristics rather than from the database.)\n\nSo basically, to future end users:\nFile -> Load Game will be how they play games.\nLibrary -> (specific system) can be thought of as an infinitely-sized\n    recent games list.\n\npurify will likely become a simple stub that invokes ananke's functions.\nNo reason to duplicate all that code."], "commit_time": ["2012-11-05T08:22:50Z"]},

"commit_description": ["\nbyuu says:\n\nChangelog:\n- updated to newest hiro API\n- SFC performance profile builds once again\n- hiro: Qt port completed\n\nErrata 1: the hiro/Qt target won't run tomoko just yet. Starts by\ncrashing inside InputSettings because hiro/Qt isn't forcefully selecting\nthe first item added to a ComboButton just yet. Even with a monkey patch\nto get around that, the UI is incredibly unstable. Lots of geometry\ncalculation bugs, and a crash when you try and access certain folders in\nthe browser dialog. Lots of work left to be done there, sadly.\n\nErrata 2: the hiro/Windows port has black backgrounds on all ListView\nitems. It's because I need to test for unassigned colors and grab the\ndefault Windows brush colors in those cases.\n\nNote: alternating row colors on multi-column ListView widgets is gone\nnow. Not a bug. May add it back later, but I'm not sure. It doesn't\ninteract nicely with per-cell background colors.\n\nThings left to do:\n\nFirst, I have to fix the Windows and Qt target bugs.\n\nNext, I need to go through and revise the hiro API even more (nothing\ntoo major.)\n\nNext, I need to update icarus to use the new hiro API, and add support\nfor the SFC games database.\n\nNext, I have to rewrite my TSV->BML cheat code tool.\n\nNext, I need to post a final WIP of higan+icarus publicly and wait a few\ndays.\n\nNext, I need to fix any bugs reported from the final WIP that I can.\n\nFinally, I should be able to release v095."], "commit_time": ["2015-08-18T10:18:00Z"]},

Many\nother changes are also present.\n\nIt's very important to note that this release now defaults to optimal\ndrivers rather than safe drivers. This is particularly important if you\ndo not have strong OpenGL 3.2 drivers. If performance is bad, go to\nSettings -> Configuration -> Advanced, change the video driver, and\nrestart higan. In the rare case that you have trouble opening higan, you\ncan edit settings.bml directly and change the setting there. The Windows\nsafe driver is Direct3D, and the Linux safe driver is XShm.\n\nAlso note that although display emulation shaders are now supported,\nthey have not been included in this release as they are not ready yet.\nThe support has been built-in anyway, so that they can be tested by\neveryone. Once refined, future releases of higan will come with built-in\nshaders for each emulated system that simulates the unique display\ncharacteristics of each.\n\nChangelog (since v093):\n- sfc: added SA-1 MDR support (fixes SD Gundam G-Next bug)\n- sfc: remove random/ and config/, merge to system/ with better\n  randomization\n- gb: improved color emulation palette contrast\n- gbc: do not sort sprites by X-priority\n- gbc: allow transparency on BG priority pixels\n- gbc: VRAM DMA timing and register fixes\n- gbc: block invalid VRAM DMA transfer source and target addresses\n- gba: added LCD color emulation (without it, colors are grossly\n  over-saturated)\n- gba: removed internal frame blending (use shaders to simulate motion\n  blur if desired)\n- gba: added Game Boy Player support (adds joypad rumble support to\n  supported games)\n- gba: SOUND_CTL_H is readable\n- gb/gbc: PPU renderer is now cycle-based (major accuracy improvement)\n- gb/gbc: OAM DMA runs in parallel with the CPU\n- gb/gbc: only HRAM can be accessed during OAM DMA\n- gb/gbc: fixed serialization of games with SRAM\n- gb/gbc: disallow up+down or left+right at the same time\n- gb/gbc: added weak hipass filter to remove DC bias\n- gb/gbc: STAT OAM+Hblank IRQs only trigger during active display\n- gb/gbc: fixed underflow in window clamping\n- gb/gbc/gba: audio mixes internally at 2MHz now instead of 4MHz (does\n  not affect accuracy)\n- gb/gbc/gba: audio volume reduced for consistency with other systems\n- fc/sfc/gb/gbc/gba: cheat codes are now stored in universal, decrypted\n  format\n- ethos: replaced file loader with a proper game library\n- ethos: added display emulation shader support\n- ethos: added color emulation option to video settings\n- ethos: program icon upgraded from 48x48 to 512x512\n- ethos: settings and tools windows now use tab frames (less wasted\n  screen space)\n- ethos: default to optimal (video, audio, input) drivers instead of\n  safest drivers\n- ethos: input mapping system completely rewritten to support\n  hotplugging and unique device mappings\n- ruby: added fixes for OpenGL 3.2 on AMD graphics cards\n- ruby: quark shaders now support user settings inside of manifest\n- ruby: quark shaders can use integral textures (allows display\n  emulation shaders to work with raw colors)\n- ruby: add joypad rumble support\n- ruby: XInput (Xbox 360) controllers now support hotplugging\n- ruby: added Linux udev joypad driver with hotplug support\n- phoenix: fixed a rare null pointer dereference issue on Windows\n- port: target -std=c++11 instead of -std=gnu++11 (do not rely on GNU\n  C++ extensions)\n- port: added out-of-the-box compilation support for BSD/Clang 3.3+\n- port: applied a few Debian upstream patches\n- cheats: updated to mightymo's 2014-01-02 release; decrypted all Game\n  Genie codes"], "commit_time": ["2014-01-20T08:55:17Z"]},

scratch, and bsnes/ui + bsnes/ui-gameboy have been updated to use the new API. Debugger works too. Currently, only phoenix/Qt is completed, and there are two known issues:\n\n1: font sizes of menu items are wrong, I can fix this easily enough\n2: there's some sort of multi-second lag when loading games, not sure\n   what's happening there yet\n\nThe new phoenix isn't exactly complete yet, still making some key\nchanges, and then I'll start on phoenix/Windows and phoenix/GTK+.\n\nThe most noticeable difference is that you don't have to give all of the\nheader paths and PHOENIX_PLATFORM defines when compiling individual GUI\nobject files. It's only needed for phoenix.cpp itself. The overall\nstructure of the phoenix source folder is much saner as well for\nsync.sh.\n\nI'm really surprised things are working as well as they are for\na two-day power rewrite of an entire phoenix target. The other targets\nwon't be as bad insofar as the core stuff is completed this time. And\nthank god for that, I was about ready to kill myself after writing\ndozens of lines like this:\n\n    HorizontalSlider::HorizontalSlider() : state(*new State),\n    base_from_member<pHorizontalSlider&>(*new pHorizontalSlider(*this)),\n    Widget(base_from_member<pHorizontalSlider&>::value),\n    p(base_from_member<pHorizontalSlider&>::value) {}\n\nBut each platform does have some new, unique problems. phoenix/GTK+ was\nacting screwy prior to the rewrite, and will most likely still have\nissues. Even more important, one of the major points of this rewrite was\nhaving the new phoenix/core cache widget settings/data, so that I can\ndestroy and recreate widgets rather than relying on SetParent. This\nmeans that simple copying of the old phoenix/Windows won't work, and\nthis new method is significantly more involved."], "commit_time": ["2011-02-15T12:22:37Z"]},

It's only\na week or two old, so a lot of work still needs to be done before it can\ncompete with the most popular NES emulators.\n\nIt's important to clarify: bsnes is primarily an SNES emulator. That\nwill always be its forte and my core focus. I have added Game Boy\nsupport previously for Super Game Boy emulation, and I've added NES\nsupport mostly for something fun to work on to break up the monotony of\nworking on one system for seven years now. Obviously, I'd like the\nemulation to be accurate and highly compatible, but I simply cannot\nafford to invest the same amount of time and money into any other\nsystems.\n\nStill, either way the NES and GB emulation serve as fun side-diversions,\nand allow for a unified emulator interface with all of bsnes' unique\nfeatures applied to all systems. My personal favorite feature is\nmightymo's extended built-in cheat code database that now also includes\nNES and Game Boy codes. And it even works in Super Game Boy mode now,\ntoo!\n\nI'm also not worried about speed at all: so long as NES/GB are faster\nthan SNES/compatibility, it's fine by me. Note that due to the NES audio\nrunning at 1.78MHz, and Game Boy audio at 4MHz stereo, a more\nsophisticated audio resampler was needed: Ryphecha (Mednafen author) has\ngraciously written a first-rate resampler: it is a band-limited\nKaiser-windowed polyphase sinc resampler. It is combined with two\nhighpass filters to remove DC bias. The filter itself is SSE optimized,\nbut even still, approximately 50% of CPU usage for NES/GB emulation goes\nto the audio filtering alone. However, you now have the best sound\npossible for NES and Game Boy emulation as a result.\n\nThe GUI has also been heavily re-structured to accommodate multiple\nemulators from the same interface. As such, it's quite likely a few bugs\nare still lurking here and there. Please report them and I'll iron them\nout for the next release.\n\nChangelog:\n- license is now GPLv3\n- re-structured GUI as a multi-system emulator\n- added NES emulation [byuu, Ryphecha]\n- added NES ICs: MMC1, MMC2, MMC3, MMC4, MMC5, VRC4, VRC6+audio, VRC7,\n  Sunsoft-5B+audio, Bandai-LZ93D50\n- added NES boards: AxROM, BNROM, CNROM, ExROM, FxROM, GxROM, NROM,\n  PxROM, SxROM, TxROM, UxROM\n- Game Boy emulation improvements [Jonas Quinn]\n- SNES core outputs full 19-bit color (4-bit luma included) for more\n  accurate color reproduction (~5% speed hit)\n- audio resampler is now a band-limited polyphase resampler [Ryphecha]\n- cheat database includes NES+GB codes as well [mightymo, tukuyomi]\n- lots of other changes"], "commit_time": ["2011-10-14T10:05:25Z"]},

Plan is for all data accesses inside my emulation cores\nto take stream objects, especially MSU1.  This lets you feed the core\nanything: memorystream, filestream, zipstream, gzipstream, httpstream,\netc.  There will still be exceptions for link and serial, those need\nactual library files on disk. But those aren't official hardware devices\nanyway.\n\nSo to help with speed a bit, I'm rethinking the video rendering path.\n\nPrevious system:\n- core outputs system-native samples (SNES = 19-bit LRGB, NES = 9-bit\n  emphasis+palette, DMG = 2-bit grayscale, etc.)\n- interfaceSystem transforms samples to 30-bit via lookup table inside\n  the emulation core\n- interfaceSystem masks off overscan areas, if enabled\n- interfaceUI runs filter to produce new target buffer, if enabled\n- interfaceUI transforms 30-bit video to native display depth (24-bit or\n  30-bit), and applies color-adjustments (gamma, etc) at the same time\n\nNew system:\n- all cores now generate an internal palette, and call\n  Interface::videoColor(uint32_t source, uint16_t red, uint16_t green,\n  uint16_t blue) to get native display color post-adjusted (gamma, etc\n  applied already.)\n- all cores output to uint32_t* buffer now (output video.palette[color]\n  instead of just color)\n- interfaceUI runs filter to produce new target buffer, if enabled\n- interfaceUI memcpy()'s buffer to the video card\n\nvideoColor() is pretty neat. source is the raw pixel (as per the\nold-format, 19-bit SNES, 9-bit NES, etc), and you can create a color\nfrom that if you really want to. Or return that value to get a buffer\njust like v088 and below.  red, green, blue are 16-bits per channel,\nbecause why the hell not, right? Just lop off all the bits you don't\nwant. If you have more bits on your display than that, fuck you :P\n\nThe last step is extremely difficult to avoid. Video cards can and do\nhave pitches that differ from the width of the texture.  Trying to make\nthe core account for this would be really awful. And even if we did\nthat, the emulation routine would need to write directly to a video card\nRAM buffer.  Some APIs require you to lock the video buffer while\nwriting, so this would leave the video buffer locked for a long time.\nProbably not catastrophic, but still awful.  And lastly, if the\nemulation core tried writing directly to the display texture, software\nfilters would no longer be possible (unless you -really- jump through\nhooks and divert to a memory buffer when a filter is enabled, but ...\nfuck.)\n\nAnyway, the point of all that work was to eliminate an extra video copy,\nand the need for a really painful 30-bit to 24-bit conversion (three\nshifts, three masks, three array indexes.) So this basically reverts us,\nperformance-wise, to where we were pre-30 bit support.\n\n[...]\n\nThe downside to this is that we're going to need a filter for each\noutput depth. Since the array type is uint32_t*, and I don't intend to\nsupport higher or lower depths, we really only need 24+30-bit versions\nof each filter.  Kinda shitty, but oh well."], "commit_time": ["2012-04-27T12:12:53Z"]},
