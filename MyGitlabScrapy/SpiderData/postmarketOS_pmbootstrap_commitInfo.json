Before this patch, the statically compiled\nQEMU binaries were taken from Debian (mostly because I did not realize\nthat Alpine ships them as well). Now we can use the ones from the aport.\n\nBenefits:\nThis allows us to easily update and patch the QEMU executables, we\ndon't need to be in sync with Debian's versions anymore.\n\nAlpine's package is more modular, so we can save some download,\ninstall, zap time, as well as disk space: setting up an armhf chroot\nwith pmbootstrap took ~102 MB before, now it's ~18 MB.\n\nDetailed changes:\n* Remove `cross/qemu-user-static-repack` aport\n* Add `data/qemu-user-binfmt.txt` with the binfmt_misc flags for ELF\n  binaries of various arches (extracted from Debian's packaging)\n* When parsing that file, don't write verbose messages to\n  `pmbootstrap log` anymore, only to the verbose log (can be enabled\n  with `pmbootstrap -v`)\n* Rename `pmb.parse.arch.alpine_to_debian()` to ...`alpine_to_qemu()`\n* Rename `arch_debian` to `arch_qemu`"], "commit_time": ["2018-08-01T21:38:37Z", "2018-08-10T15:11:21Z"]},

It always falled back to running the\ncompiler in QEMU (which works, but is a lot slower). The reason for that is,\nthat distcc requires all compilers that are being used in a whitelist now.\n\nThis partially fixes CVE-2004-2687 in distccd, which allowed trivial remote\ncode execution by any process connecting to the distccd server. We only run\ndistccd on localhost, but still this can be used for privilege escalation of\nsandboxed processes running on the host system (not part of pmbootstrap\nchroots).\n\nBecause the CVE is only partially fixed (see the comment in\n`pmb/chroot/distccd.py` for details), we make sure that only the building\nchroots can talk to the distcc server by running distcc over ssh.\n\nDetails:\n* Completely refactored `pmb/chroot/distccd.py` to run distcc over ssh\n  * Store the running distcc server's arguments as JSON now, not as INI\n* Make debugging distcc issues easy:\n  * Set DISTCC_BACKOFF_PERIOD=0, so the distcc client will not ignore the\n    server after errors happened (this masks the original error!)\n  * New pmbootstrap parameters:\n    * `--distcc-nofallback`: avoids falling back to compiling with QEMU and not\n\t   throwing an error\n\t* `--ccache-disable`: avoid ccache (when the compiler output is cached,\n\t  distcc does not get used)\n  * `--verbose` prints verbose output of the distcc too\n  * New test case, that uses the new pmbootstrap parameters to force\n\tcompilation through distcc, and shows the output of distcc and distccd in\n\tverbose mode on error (as well as the log of sshd)"], "commit_time": ["2018-07-25T19:09:45Z", "2018-07-26T09:47:23Z"]},

We\nused to directly pass all arguments to `newapkbuild` without verifying\nin Python whether they make sense or not. However, as `newpakbuild`\ndoesn't do strict sanity checks on the arguments, it is easy to end up\nwith unexpected behavior when using the command for the first time.\n\nFor example, `newapkbuild` allows either specifying a PKGNAME or SRCURL\nas last parameter, and also allows setting a PKGNAME with the `-n`\nparameter. It only makes sense to use that option when passing a\nSRCURL.\n\nWith this commit, we duplicate the optins that should be passed through\nto `newapkbuild` and use argparse to fully sanitize the options and\ndisplay a help page (`pmbootstrap newapkbuild -h`) that is consistent\nwith the other help pages.\n\nDetails:\n* The `-f` (force) flag does not get passed through anymore. Instead we\n  use it in Python to skip asking if an existing aport should be\n  overwritten (the aports are outside of the chroot, so `newapkbuild`\n  can't handle it in a way that makes sense for pmbootstrap).\n* Output of `newapkbuild` gets redirected to the log file now, as we\n  don't need it to display a help page.\n* Don't verify the pkgver while creating the new APKBUILD. When passing\n  a SRCURL, the pkgver gets extracted from the end of the URL and may\n  not have a valid format yet (but we want the APKBUILD anyway).\n* Stored options passed through in `pmb/config/__init__.py` and use it\n  in both `pmb/parse/arguments.py` and `pmb/helpers/frontend.py`.\n* Only allow `-n` with SRCURL\n* The postmarketOS aports folder gets specified with `--folder` now.\n  That way the generated help page is much closer to the original one\n  from `newapkbuild`. The default is `main`.\n* Made the package type flags (CMake, autotools, ...) exclusive so only\n  one of them can be specified"], "commit_time": ["2018-03-15T21:42:34Z", "2018-03-15T21:42:34Z"]},

But it needed to be manually updated. Otherwise\nthe `pmbootstrap aportgen` command could actually downgrade the aport\ninstead of updating it to the current version.\n\nAfter thinking about adding a dedicated pmbootstrap command for\nupdating git repositories, I thought it would be better to not open\nthat can of worms (pmbootstrap as general git wrapper? no thanks).\n\nThe solution implemented here compares the upstream aport version of\nthe git checkout of a certain package (e.g. gcc for gcc-armhf) with the\nversion in Alpine's binary package APKINDEX. When the aport version is\nlower than the binary package version, it shows the user how to update\nthe git repository with just one command:\n\n    pmbootstrap chroot --add=git --user -- \\\n        git -C /mnt/pmbootstrap-git/aports_upstream pull\n\nChanges:\n* `pmb.aportgen.core.get_upstream_aport()`: new function, that returns\n  the absolute path to the upstream aport on disk, after checking the\n  version of the aport against the binary package.\n* Use that new function in pmb.aportgen.gcc and pmb.aportgen.binutils\n* New function `pmb.helpers.repo.alpine_apkindex_path()`: updates the\n  APKINDEX if necessary and returns the absolute path to the APKINDEX.\n  This code was basically present already, but not as function, so now\n  we have a bit less overhead there.\n* `pmbootstrap chroot`: new `--user` argument\n* `pmb.parse.apkbuild`: make pkgname check optional, as it fails with\n  the official gcc APKBUILD before we modify it (the current APKBUILD\n  parser is not meant to be perfect, as this would require a full shell\n  parsing implementation).\n* Extended `test_aportgen.py` and enabled it by default in\n  `testcases_fast.sh`.  Previously it was disabled due to traffic\n  concerns (cloning the aports repo, but then again we do a full KDE\n  plasma mobile installation in Travis now, so that shouldn't matter\n  too much).\n* `testcases_fast.sh`: With \"test_aport_in_sync_with_git\" removed\n  from the disabled-by-default list (left over from timestamp based\n  rebuilds), there were no more test cases disabled by default. I've\n  changed it, so now the qemu_running_processes test case is disabled,\n  and added an `--all` parameter to the script to disable no test\n  cases. Travis runs with the `--all` parameter while it's useful to\n  do a quick local test without `--all` in roughly 2 minutes instead of\n  10.\n* `aports/cross/binutils-*`: Fix `_mirror` variable to point to current\n  default Alpine mirror (so the aportgen testcase runs through)."], "commit_time": ["2018-03-11T14:18:21Z", "2018-03-11T14:18:21Z"]},

The use case is passing a description with\na space inside to `newapkbuild` with `pmboostrap newapkbuild`.\n\nThis is not a security issue, as we don't pass strings from untrusted\ninput to this function.\n\n## Functions for running commands in pmbootstrap\nTo put the rest of the description in context: We have four high level\nfunctions that run commands:\n* `pmb.helpers.run.user()`\n* `pmb.helpers.run.root()`\n* `pmb.chroot.root()`\n* `pmb.chroot.user()`\n\nIn addition, one low level function that the others invoke:\n* `pmb.helpers.run.core()`\n\n## Flawed test case\nThe issue described above did not get detected for so long, because we\nhave a test case in place since day one, which verifies that all of the\nfunctions above escape everything properly:\n* `test/test_shell_escape.py`\n\nSo the test case ran a given command through all these functions, and\ncompared the result each time. However, `pmb.chroot.root()`\nmodified the command variable (passed by reference) and did the\nescaping already, which means `pmb.chroot.user()` running directly\nafterwards only returns the right output when *not* doing any escaping.\n\nWithout questioning the accuracy of the test case, I've escaped\ncommands and environment variables with `shlex.quote()` *before*\npassing them to `pmb.chroot.user()`. In retrospective this does not\nmake sense at all and is reverted with this commit.\n\n## Environment variables\nBy coincidence, we have only passed custom environment variables to\n`pmb.chroot.user()`, never to the other high level functions. This only\nworked, because we did not do any escaping and the passed line gets\nexecuted as shell command:\n```\n$ MYENV=test echo test2\ntest 2\n```\nIf it was properly escaped as one shell command:\n```\n$ 'MYENV=test echo test2'\nsh: MYENV=test echo test2: not found\n```\nSo doing that clearly doesn't work anymore. I have added a new `env`\nparameter to `pmb.chroot.user()` (and to all other high level functions\nfor consistency), where environment variables can be passed as a\ndictionary. Then the function knows what to do and we end up with\nproperly escaped commands and environment variables.\n\n## Details\n* Add new `env` parameter to all high level command execution functions\n* New `pmb.helpers.run.flat_cmd()` function, that takes a command as\n  list and environment variables as dict, and creates a properly escaped\n  flat string from the input.\n* Use that function for proper escaping in all high level exec funcs\n* Don't escape commands *before* passing them to `pmb.chroot.user()`\n* Describe parameters of the command execution functions\n* `pmbootstrap -v` writes the exact command to the log that was\n  executed (in addition to the simplified form we always write down for\n  readability)\n* `test_shell_escape.py`: verify that the command passed by reference\n  has not been modified, add a new test for strings with spaces, add\n  tests for new function `pmb.helpers.run.flat_cmd()`\n* Remove obsolete commend in `pmb.chroot.distccd` about environment\n  variables, because we don't use any there anymore\n* Add `TERM=xterm` to default environment variables in the chroot,\n  so running ncurses applications like `menuconfig` and `nano` works out of\n  the box"], "commit_time": ["2018-03-10T22:58:39Z", "2018-03-10T22:58:39Z"]},

For multiple providers, the one with the same package\n  name as the package we are looking up is prefered. If there is none\n  (eg. \"so:libEGL.so.1\" is provided by \"mesa-egl\"), it prefers packages\n  that will be installed anyway, and after that packages that are\n  already installed. When all else fails, it just picks the first one\n  and prints a note in the \"pmbootstrap log\".\n* Added testcases for all functions in pmb.parse.apkindex and\n  pmb.parse.depends\n* pmbootstrap chroot has a new \"--add\" parameter to specify packages\n  that pmbootstrap should build if neccessary, and install in the\n  chroot. This can be used to quickly test the depencency resolution\n  of pmbootstrap without doing a full \"pmbootstrap install\".\n\nFixes ", "."], "commit_time": ["2018-02-20T19:52:28Z", "2018-02-20T19:52:28Z"]},

In native mode, these get compied to the\nnative architecture, in distcc mode to the target architecture.\n\nThe problem is, that we need these scripts compiled for the target\narchitecture in the kernel's dev package in order to compile kernel\nmodules outside of the kernel's package (e.g. wireguard).\n\nIt is not possible to just rewrite this logic to generate target-arch\nbinaries when running in native mode, because these binaries require\nmusl-dev, linux-headers and some other packages to be installed for the\ntarget architecture inside the native chroot.\n\nWe solve this by introducing a new `kernel-scripts` package. which\ncontains just the binary scripts. In case the dev package was\ncross-compiled, it depends on `kernel-scripts` and symlinks these\nbinaries. The `kernel-scripts` package always gets compiled in distcc\nmode since it does not have a `linux-` prefix.\n\nFixes ", "."], "commit_time": ["2018-02-16T21:00:37Z", "2018-02-16T21:00:37Z"]},

Instead of one big function that does\n  too many things, we have many small ones now, that are tested\n  in the testsuite and easier to modify\n* Whenever building a package, pmbootstrap does not only build and\n  install the \"makedepends\" (like we did before), now it does the\n  same for the \"depends\". That's required to be compatible with\n  abuild. The old behavior can still be used with 'pmbootstrap\n  build --ignore-depends'.\n* Because of that change, noarch packages can no longer be built in\n  the native chroot if we need them for a foreign chroot. A device-\n  package depending on a kernel would pull in the same kernel for\n  the native architecture otherwise.\n* Running 'pmbootstrap build device-...' without '--ignore-depends'\n  and without a matching '--arch' displays a note that explains\n  this change to the user and tells how to use it instead.\n* Noarch packages no longer get symlinked. That was only\n  implemented for packages built in the native chroot, and now that\n  is not always the case anymore. Symlinking these packages creates\n  packages with broken dependencies anyway (e.g.\n  device-samsung-i9100 can't be installed in x86_64, because\n  linux-samsung-i9100 is armhf only).\n* Rename \"carch\" to \"arch\" wherever used. Naming it \"carch\"\n  sometimes is confusing with no benefit.\n* Add a testcase for the aarch64 qemu workaround (because it failed\n  first and I needed to know for sure if it is working again).\n* Improved some verbose logging, which helped with development of\n  this feature.\n* Removed the old \"build\" test case (which was disabled in\n  testcases_fast.sh) as the new \"build_package\" test case covers its\n  functionallity.\n* Only build indexes if the packages folder exists for that arch (Travis\n  couldn't run a test case otherwise)"], "commit_time": ["2017-11-26T14:32:02Z", "2017-11-26T14:32:02Z"]},

It doesn't only consider packages outdated with old pkgver/pkgrel combinations, but also packages, where a source file has a newer timestamp, than the built package has.\n\nI've found out, that this can lead to more rebuilds than expected. For example, when you check out the pmbootstrap git repository again into another folder, although you have already built packages. Then all files have the timestamp of the checkout, and the packages will appear to be outdated. While this is not largely a concern now, this will become a problem once we have a binary package repository, because then the packages from the binary repo will always seem to be outdated, if you just freshly checked out the repository.\n\nTo combat this, git gets asked if the files from the aport we're looking at are in sync with upstream, or not. Only when the files are not in sync with upstream and the timestamps of the sources are newer, a rebuild gets triggered from now on.\n\nIn case this logic should fail, I've added an option during \"pmbootstrap init\" where you can enable or disable the \"timestamp based rebuilds\" option.\n\nIn addition to that, this commit also works on fixing ", ": packages do not get updated in \"pmbootstrap install\" after they have been rebuilt. For this to work, we specify all packages explicitly for abuild, instead of letting abuild do the resolving. This feature will also work with the \"timestamp based rebuilds\".\n\nThis commit also fixes the working_dir argument in pmb.helpers.run.user, which was simply ignored before.\n\nFinally, the performance of the dependency resolution is faster again (when compared to the current version in master), because the parsed apkbuilds and finding the aport by pkgname gets cached during one pmbootstrap call (in args.cache, which also makes it easy to put fake data there in testcases).\n\nThe new dependency resolution code can output lots of verbose messages for debugging by specifying the `-v` parameter. The meaning of that changed, it used to output the file names where log messages come from, but no one seemed to use that anyway."], "commit_time": ["2017-07-10T15:23:43Z", "2017-07-10T15:23:43Z"]},
