Although\nit seems the user would have to try quite hard to do this, it's\nincorrect to return that index into letters.  Change \"ch.ch==0\" to be\nconsidered the same as an abort.\n\nis_email_wsp() is used in a couple places where it wasn't obvious\nwhether '\\0' was being accounted for, so add an explicit check to the\nfunction.\n\nInside eat_date(), if mutt_extract_token() had no input and returned\n\"\", the strchr (\"<>=\", buffer.data[0]) below would return a pointer.\nIn actuality, this is prevented by an empty parameter check inside\nmutt_pattern_comp(), but it doesn't hurt to make it the same as\neat_regexp() and have the check explicitly done here too.\n\nrfc2047_encode() was another borderline case for adding a check.  The\nconvert_string() sets a length, so it seems highly unlikely that *t\ncould be 0, but doesn't hurt to add the check.\n\nThe find_encoded_word() fix looks necessary.  If the passed in s was\nsomething like \"=?charset?\" (followed by EOS, '\\0'), the strchr(\"BbQq\",\nq[1]) would in fact return a pointer and the following q[2] would read\npast the end of string.  If q[2] happened to be '?', it might even\ncontinue reading in the for loop below.\n\nLastly, in parse_mailboxdomain(), the potential overread was already\nfixed in changeset:a6919571eb59, but although the nonspecial and special\nstrchr() line happens to \"work\" for the case of '\\0', it's pretty\nfragile to leave as is.

This avoids the issue of how do you\nhave a client-id and client-secret for an open source project, and the fact\nthat OAUTH discovery is still nascent, so you'd likely need separate things\nfor each of the providers.\n\nAt least for Gmail, you can use the oauth2.py script from Google's\ngmail-oauth2-tools:\n", "\n\nYou'd need to get your own oauth client credentials for Gmail here:\n", "\n\nThen, you'd use oauth2.py with --generate_oauth2_token to get a refresh\ntoken, and configure mutt with:\n\nset imap_authenticators=\"oauthbearer\"\nset imap_user=\"<email_address>\"\nset imap_pass=`/path/to/oauth2.py --quiet --user=<email_address>\n--client_id=<client_id> --client_secret=<client_secret>\n--refresh_token=<refresh_token>`\n\nFor this patch, I didn't add any new configuration, but I'm open to\nsuggestions on that.\n\nThe patch also only support SASL-IR to reduce round-trips to the server,\nbut it's certainly possible to change that if we think there are\nOAUTHBEARER IMAP servers that don't support SASL-IR.  It also requires the\nconnection to be encrypted as the access token is re-usable for an hour or\nso.  Again, Gmail only allows encrypted IMAP connections, not sure if any\nOAUTHBEARER services allow non-encrypted.\n\nTurns out that auth failure leaves you in SASL mode, so I have a hack to\nissue a noop command on error.  Not sure if that's just OAUTHBEARER\noddness, or whether I should be using lower level mutt imap functions."], "commit_time": ["2018-06-11T17:39:49Z", "2018-06-14T01:41:06Z"]},

However, this is causing a segfault, and the best solution\nright now is to turn active back on for non-expunged messages in\nimap_expunge_mailbox().\n\nExtra thanks to chdiza, who bravely runs tip and found this issue\nquickly."], "commit_time": ["2017-09-22T18:07:27Z"]},

Spam tags are retrieved from cache and not updated when\nspam rules change.\n\n1. Enable header caching in muttrc\n2. Set spam rules in muttrc\n3. Use IMAP (or POP or Maildir).  Your spam rules store spam tags into\n   your message headers, and these get cached.\n4. Quit mutt\n5. Change your spam rules in muttrc\n6. Relaunch mutt\n7. Because of header caching, the rfc822 headers are not reparsed, and\n   spam rules are not reapplied.  User has outdated spam tags.\n\nSpam rules are applied during rfc822 header parsing because it's the\nonly time we get a full and unadulterated view of all headers.  Once\nheader parse is done we have only processed headers and 'user headers'\n(X-headers).  We might do spam rule matching against the struct HEADER\ncopy of headers, except that:\n\na. the header might not be in HEADER if it's non-standard and not an\n   X-header;\nb. spam rules are regular expressions matching any arbitrary header\n   line, and we would need to map these regexps to the header used to\n   create the HEADER fields.  This would change the syntax and behavior\n   of spam rules dramatically.\n\nOne solution, perhaps stopgap, is to invalidate the header cache when\nspam rules change.  That's what this patch does.  It alters the hcache\nversioning algorithm so that in addition to using the compiled-in\nchecksum of mutt's structures definitions, we also mix in the user's\nruntime spam rules.

It no longer depends on a static list of supported\nterminal types, although it will use default support for these terminal\ntypes *if* they do not advertise tsl/fsl or XT in terminfo.\n\nThe generic terminal status line can be implemented in any fashion, and\non hardware terminals it can be a special out-of-screen region of the\ndisplay.  Most modern terminal emulators appear to emulate the status\nline in the window title; thus the notion of the tsl escape as an xterm\nwindow title escape.\n\nConfiguration variables have been renamed:\n$ts_status_format\n    format string (using $status_format codes) for the terminal status line\n$ts_icon_format\n    format string (using $status_format codes) for the xterm icon name\n$ts_enabled\n    toggle for whether to issue status updates\n\nThe old configuration names exist as synonyms.\n\nLogic flow:\n* If tsl (string) is set in terminfo, mutt will use that escape to switch\n  to the status area, and will use fsl to switch back to the regular\n  display area.\n* Otherwise, if XT (boolean) is set in terminfo, mutt will use the\n  standard xterm-compatible escapes.\n* Otherwise, if $TERM matches a known terminal type, mutt will use the\n  standard xterm-compatible escapes.\n* Otherwise, this feature is disabled.\n\n= NOTE =\n\nThe XTerm icon escape sequence is not formalized in terminfo, so the\negregious kludge of hardcoding the escape is necessary in this case.\nHowever, some terminal emulators (e.g. MacOS X Terminal.app) will set\nthe status line (window title) when the icon sequence is received.\nSince there is no way to detect this behavior, the only solution is to\nwrite your configuration to take it into account.  Rather than add a\nvariable to control icon escapes separately, we just provide the advice:\nif you use such a terminal, you may wish to set ts_icon_format to an\nempty string.  This will cause it not to be used."], "commit_time": ["2013-10-22T19:15:01Z"]},

The reason is because km_error_key() tries to\nverify that the key sequence is really bound to the OP_HELP operation.\nIt does this by using km_expand_key(), tokenize_unget_string() on the\nresulting buffer, then checking if the next km_dokey() returns OP_HELP.\n\nThe problem is that km_expand_key() does not always produce a string\nthat is properly reparsed by tokenize_unget_string().  Control-h\nsequences are expanded to ^H.  tokenize_unget_string() recognizes this\nas two characters '^' and 'H'.  km_error_key() checks the OP returned,\nwhich is OP_PAGER_TOP for the '^'.  This is not OP_HELP, so it prints\na generic error and returns.  This leaves the 'H' in the input buffer!\nSince 'H' (by default) is unbound in the pager, it retriggers\nkm_error_key(), resulting in an infinite loop.\n\nThe same issues can occur without control sequences:\n  bind generic ? noop\n  bind generic dq help\nIn the index, hitting an unbound key will end up leaving 'q' in the unget\nbuffer, because 'd' is bound in the index menu and will be read by km_dokey().\n\nA simple approach to fix this would be to just use the same code as in\nmutt_make_help(), which has no double-check.  This would be no worse\nthan the help menu, but can generate an inaccurate error message (e.g\nif '?' were bound to noop)\n\nThis patch instead uses OP_END_COND as a barrier in the unget buffer.\nIt directly inserts the keys in the OP_HELP keymap, instead of using\nkm_expand_key() + tokenize_unget_string().  After calling km_dokey()\nit flushes the unget buffer to the OP_END_COND barrier.\n\nThanks to Walter Alejandro Iglesias for reporting the bug."], "commit_time": ["2017-04-28T04:22:08Z"]},

One drawback is that the help menu does always list all crypto\nrealted stuff even when configured for no crypto at all.  Same goes\nfor the configure options but I consider thsi a feature: It allows to\nuse the same .muttrc for different versions of mutt - at least during\ndevelopment, this is an advantage.  This all might be fixed but\nrequires some changes to the configuration system.\n\nNote, the use of the WithCrypto macro - it enables the compiler to do\ndead-code-elimination depending on the configured backend.  This is\nbetter readable than all the nested ifdefs.  I did some short tests\nand it seems to work, althoug mutt's size does not change largely when\ncompiled w/o crypto.\n\ncryptglue.c is new as a warpper to all crypto calls; some are still in\ncrypt.c but they should eventually also be wrapped.

Toggling read-only still\n   doesn't work correctly - you may lose your 'N' flags if you open\n   a folder normally and switch to read-only.\n\n  I've also decided to try using UID FETCH, although I'm not sure if\n  older IMAP servers support it, but then again I'm not sure if\n  anyone's using any really old IMAP servers. The main advantage is\n  in the case of multiple clients, where one client is deleting\n  messages and the other isn't getting notification. I'm\n  experiencing that on my UW-IMAP 4.6 server. On the other hand,\n  this server seems to have all sorts of terrible problems with this\n  scenario, so I'm not sure how well the code functions. It's a\n  two-line change so far, it's experimental, and it's the only IMAP\n  code in an #if 0 block..."], "commit_time": ["2000-01-25T21:21:10Z"]},

Anyway, last->val is still\n   NULL, so it is correct to write the complete addr spec\n   to last->val."], "commit_time": ["1998-08-26T19:13:33Z"]},
