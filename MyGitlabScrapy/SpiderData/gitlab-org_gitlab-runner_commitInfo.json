They are used only for\ntests and not for the production use.\n\nUnfortunately, because the files are not named as *_test.go - to allow\nuse the mocks in tests outside of the mock source package - they are\ncounted to the coverage report.\n\nWe're using ", " to automatically generate\nmock files basing on interfaces. Mockery is creating mocks, that\naccept both scalar values as well as functions that accept mocked method\nargumets and returns mocked method result. However, we're mostly not\nusing this mocking mechanism.\n\nFinally this ends in a lot of mocks code being not covered in test,\nwhich decreases the overall coverage value. While we're totally not\ninterested in having coverage for mocks!\n\nThis commit aims to remove all mocks from the coverage profile file,\nwhich should remove them from both percentage value calculation and the\nHTML/jUnit reports."], "commit_time": ["2019-04-25T09:03:21Z"]},

Those information are helpful however we've noticed that in some cases we need to have a detailed information about data flows and function calls inside of a running Runner's process. That's why we've decided to add `pprof` integration.\n\nAfter merging this MR `pprof` endpoints will be available on the same `host:port` as the integrated metrics server, under the `/debug/pprof/` URI.\n\n## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?\n\nI've analyzed the `net/http/pprof` package to check if importing it (which automatically registers some endpoints to an existing HTTP server) will add any complexity or resources usage overhead. In my opinion it doesn't add anything until the endpoint is called (and only then data is collected). But it would be nice if someone else would look on this.\n\n## Does this MR meet the acceptance criteria?\n\n- [x] Documentation created/updated\n- Tests\n  - [ ] Added for this feature/bug\n  - [ ] All builds are passing\n- [ ] Branch has no merge conflicts with `master` (if you do - rebase it please)\n\n## What are the relevant issue numbers?\n\n/cc ", "\n\nSee merge request "], "commit_time": ["2016-12-05T11:11:21Z"]},

The default of zero means run forever.   Previously, it appeared this option did not do anything.\n * Adds a new `--wait-timeout` option that specifies how long a the runner will wait for jobs.  The default of zero means wait forever\n\n## Why was this MR needed?\nThis MR introduces new functionality that is useful when you want to run the gitlab-runner on cluster resources managed by a DRM like LSF.  \nIn these systems, you cannot have an executable running forever.  Instead you submit jobs (executable) to run for a max-time.  \nWith the new functionality of this MR, you can submit a job to run the gitlab-runner in `run-single` mode with `--limit=1 --wait-timeout=600`.   If a job becomes available within 600 seconds, it will be built, and then the runner will exit, returning the machine resources back to the cluster.\n\n## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?\n- [x] Understand the `complexity` build failure.\n- [x] Understand the `unit tests` build failure.\n- [ ] This code has only been tested with the \"shell\" and \"docker\" executors.

If set to a listening address, a Prometheus HTTP server is started with the following metrics:\n\n- runner business logic metrics (currently only number of currently running builds)\n- build version information\n- Go process metrics (GC stats, goroutines, memstats, ...)\n- general process metrics (FDs, memory, cpu usage, ...)\n\nA full example `/metrics` output can be found here: ", "\n\nThis depends on the data race fix in ", ", so it's based ontop of that.\n\nThe approach to integrating the `metrics_server` configuration option was taken from ", ".\n\n## Why was this MR needed?\n\nWe need better insight into the entire CI system, and currently we have no white-box metrics.\n\n## Are there points in the code the reviewer needs to double check?\n\n### General metrics approach\n\nThere were multiple different ways of approaching this. The more \"traditional\" Prometheus style is to just register all metrics from anywhere in the codebase in the global default Prometheus registry (similar to how logging is often treated as a global concern without dependency-injecting a logger; and analogous to using `http.Handle(...)` to register a handler with the global HTTP mux).\n\nHowever, from reading the rest of this codebase, it seemed to me like an approach with explicit dependencies and less global state would be preferred by the authors. So I'm instantiating a custom Prometheus metrics registry and registering the Go and process metrics collectors with it manually (those are included automatically in the default metrics registry). I also am using the `prometheus.Collector` interface to encapsulate the metrics of a type, instead of the simpler approach of just defining global metrics. For an example of the latter, see the example at the top of ", ". Generally, this all leads to somewhat more code, but more explicit dependencies and encapsulation.\n\n### Configuration reloading\n\nLike in ", ", the metrics HTTP server does not allow for reconfiguration. In Go, it's also not trivial to stop an already running HTTP server. So right now, only whatever is configured at process startup takes effect. Is that ok? Should it be a command-line flag instead?\n\nPlease let me know if this approach is generally going in the right direction. I know there's many other metrics we will want to add over time, but maybe let's start out simple?\n\n## Does this MR meet the acceptance criteria?\n\n- [x] Documentation created/updated\n- Tests\n  - [ ] Added for this feature/bug\n  - [x] All builds are passing\n- [x] Branch has no merge conflicts with `master` (if you do - rebase it please)\n\n## What are the relevant issue numbers?\n\n", "\n\nSee merge request "], "commit_time": ["2016-11-03T12:50:18Z"]},

I'm running some of my builds on cloud VMs using the new autoscale feature. However, those are across a WAN from my GitLab instance. Some of the repositories that I do builds on are quite large, so the time required to just clone the code adds large overhead to the build process.\n\nI've mitigated this by setting up a caching proxy server on the cloud network using [gitpod](", "). This works great, but I need a way to configure those runners to use the proxy Git server instead.\n\nThat's where this merge request comes in. I added a new per-runner option that allows the user to inject commands before the Git clone/fetch occurs. This allows me to adjust the Git global configuration to rewrite the fetch URLs that the CI script uses to point to my proxy server instead. This seems to work and seems to be a pretty elegant solution.\n\nI then had to add a second option that allows the specification of commands before the build occurs. This was because my project has submodules in it, which are not currently cloneable by `gitlab-runner`. In my `.gitlab-ci.yml`, I have some commands to insert an SSH private key from a secure variable into the environment and subsequently clone the code. Since I use the Docker executor, the `git clone` occurs in a different container than the subsequent build commands, so my pre-clone commands don't have any effect on the build. Therefore, I added the ability to configure commands run at this point as well.\n\nI know there was some opposition to adding functionality that was like this in ", ", but I really believe this is the best place to add this feature. Any chance of this getting merged?\n\nSee merge request "], "commit_time": ["2016-09-14T12:35:45Z"]},
