And like the \"Harden file2str()\" patch, this\npatch does not fail when about to overflow, but truncates instead: there\nis information available about this process, so return it to the caller;\nalso, we used INT_MAX as a limit, but a lower limit could be used.\n\nThe easy changes:\n\n- Replace sprintf() with snprintf() (and check for truncation).\n\n- Replace \"if (n == 0 && rbuf == 0)\" with \"if (n <= 0 && tot <= 0)\" and\n  do break instead of return: it simplifies the code (only one place to\n  handle errors), and also guarantees that in the while loop either n or\n  tot is > 0 (or both), even if n is reset to 0 when about to overflow.\n\n- Remove the \"if (n < 0)\" block in the while loop: it is (and was) dead\n  code, since we enter the while loop only if n >= 0.\n\n- Rewrite the missing-null-terminator detection: in the original\n  function, if the size of the file is a multiple of 2047, a null-\n  terminator is appended even if the file is already null-terminated.\n\n- Replace \"if (n <= 0 && !end_of_file)\" with \"if (n < 0 || tot <= 0)\":\n  originally, it was equivalent to \"if (n < 0)\", but we added \"tot <= 0\"\n  to handle the first break of the while loop, and to guarantee that in\n  the rest of the function tot is > 0.\n\n- Double-force (\"belt and suspenders\") the null-termination of rbuf:\n  this is (and was) essential to the correctness of the function.\n\n- Replace the final \"while\" loop with a \"for\" loop that behaves just\n  like the preceding \"for\" loop: in the original function, this would\n  lead to unexpected results (for example, if rbuf is |\\0|A|\\0|, this\n  would return the array {\"\",NULL} but should return {\"\",\"A\",NULL}; and\n  if rbuf is |A|\\0|B| (should never happen because rbuf should be null-\n  terminated), this would make room for two pointers in ret, but would\n  write three pointers to ret).\n\nThe hard changes:\n\n- Prevent the integer overflow of tot in the while loop, but unlike\n  file2str(), file2strvec() cannot let tot grow until it almost reaches\n  INT_MAX, because it needs more space for the pointers: this is why we\n  introduced ARG_LEN, which also guarantees that we can add \"align\" and\n  a few sizeof(char*)s to tot without overflowing.\n\n- Prevent the integer overflow of \"tot + c + align\": when INT_MAX is\n  (almost) reached, we write the maximal safe amount of pointers to ret\n  (ARG_LEN guarantees that there is always space for *ret = rbuf and the\n  NULL terminator)."], "commit_time": ["1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2018-05-18T21:32:22Z"]},

Rather, scaling appears at line start.\n\nIf built without ./configure --disable-modern-top, the\nSummary Area memory will be scaled at GiB which should\nlessen chance of truncation. Otherwise KiB was used to\nreflect such memory, increasing the truncation chance.\n\nAnd while 'W' can be used to preserve some appropriate\nscaling value, there are arguments against such rcfile\napproaches as cited in the issue and bug report below.\n\nSo this commit will bump the Summary Area memory scale\nfactor from KiB to MiB when using --disable-modern-top\nas a concession to that Redhat bug report noted below.\n\nAnd it also introduces a new command line switch which\ncan force any desired scaling regardless of the rcfile\nor which ./configure option might have been specified.\n\n[ for top's help text we'll show 'E' as if it were a ]\n[ switch without arguments in order to keep the help ]\n[ text displayable without wrap in an 80x24 terminal ]\n\n[ the man page, however, will show all k-e arguments ]\n\nReference(s):\n", "\n", "Signed-off-by: "], "commit_time": ["2017-03-09T06:00:00Z", "2017-03-16T10:59:53Z"]},

Detect such a\nnull-byte terminator and goto/break out of the loop.\n\nNote: in the case of a raw \\001-\\010 character, the character at\n\"sub_end + 1\" is never processed (it is skipped/jumped over); this is\nnot a security problem anymore (since 2/ was fixed), so we decided not\nto change this behavior, for backward-compatibility.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReference(s):\n. original qualys patch\n0116-top-Fix-out-of-bounds-read-write-in-show_special.patch\ncommit ", "Signed-off-by: "], "commit_time": ["2018-05-18T05:00:00Z", "2018-05-19T11:44:35Z"]},

This gave the changes a bad reputation.\n\nThat bug was corrected in release 3.3.11 but the issue\nof default startup options keeps resurfacing. And it's\nclear there's no consensus on what should be included.\n\nOur --disable-modern-top configure option is of little\nhelp since it remains an all-or-nothing approach. What\nwe need is an answer offering unlimited customization.\nSo, this commit will provide distribution packagers or\nsystem administrators with a much more flexible way to\nset their own preferred startup default configuration.\n\nA new rcfile is being introduced: '/etc/topdefaultrc',\nwhose format/content is the same as a personal rcfile.\nThus once a 'proper' enterprise configuration has been\nestablished and saved via 'W', it can be copied to the\n/etc/ directory. Thereafter, startup in the absence of\na saved rcfile will use that configuration as default.\n\nNow if a distribution packager or system administrator\nwishes to expose their users to some of top's advanced\ncapabilities they can do so gradually. Perhaps setting\nup graph mode for summary area task and memory display\nwhile retaining the %CPU sort could be tried. Or maybe\nshowing colors, but better customized for a particular\nterminal emulator. Such possibilities are now endless.\n\n[ in exploiting this new capability, i hope that the ]\n[ other windows (alt display mode) aren't overlooked ]\n\nReference(s):\n.

There were some hacks around the code to work around the bug, but using `kill -1` on its own would end up working as if `kill -1 -1` (which means `kill -HUP <all processes>`) was executed. (Yes, it was painful when I accidentally typed it... more than once.)\n\nI also made `kill` print the usage if it only gets a signal number, but no pids (as in the `kill -1` example.)\n\nAnd `pkill` had similar code but was using a buggy atoi() to try to parse the signal number, which meant that trailing garbage was accepted, so I corrected that by removing the buggy atoi() and letting the already existing code that already accepted numeric signals do its work as supposed to...\n\nI also wanted to tackle the \"pgrp\" case where a negative number is passed to kill, causing it to kill a process group. The current code is buggy, for instance `kill -TERM -2345` will kill process group 2 and not process group 2345 as supposed to. It should also be possible to pass it multiple pgrps or a mix of pgrps and pids. It's hard to fix that though, considering how getopt_long() works, so I'll defer that for a second pull request.\n\nI tested this fairly well, both manually and made sure there were no regressions in the test suite, also didn't break `make distcheck`.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or other remarks...\n\nCheers!\nFilipe\n\nSee merge request "], "commit_time": ["2015-07-08T12:08:08Z"]},

(but htop suffers that annoying ncurses <Esc> delay)\n+ in top one need not type the PID to kill the process\n+ in top one need not type the PID to renice a process\n\nSome things the 'htop' program was not bragging about:\n------------------------------------------------------\n+ top can outperform the htop program by a wide margin\n+ htop + SIGWINCH = corrupted display + restart likely\n+ htop cannot preserve its screen data at suspend/exit\n+ the htop column management scheme is very cumbersome\n+ htop allows columns to be duplicated again and again\n+ htop displays only full command lines, not pgm names\n. (and that 'Command' column must always be displayed)\n. (and it must always remain as the last column shown)\n+ htop does not provide for any sort of command recall\n+ htop's search feature does not highlight any matches\n+ there is no 'find next' outside of htop search modes\n+ htop does not allow Header or Process memory scaling\n+ htop provides no flexibility on column justification\n+ htop does not provide the means to change col widths\n+ htop provides less control over colors configuration\n+ htop always overwrites the rcfile with any UI change\n\nSomeday, maybe we'll provide a better comparison as an\naddendum for (or replacement of) that README.top file.\nSigned-off-by: "], "commit_time": ["2014-06-18T05:00:00Z", "2014-06-22T11:39:55Z"]},

It occurred when some\nprogram (erroneously?) created a lengthy forking loop.\nHowever, the associated commit message was misleading.\n\nThe message implied that an unexpected order following\na sort on start_time was the cause of storage overruns\nand a 'char' used to track nesting level only distorts\nthe display when it goes negative. Actually, the truth\nis really just the opposite. Any start_time sort quirk\ncauses no harm while that 'char' can yield corruption.\n\nShould some child end up sorted ahead of its parent by\nway of an extremely unlikely shared start_time the end\nresult is such a child will be displayed unnested just\nlike init or kthreadd along with all its own children.\n\nHowever, if nesting levels exceeded 255 (and became 0)\na massive array overrun could be triggered when such a\ntask and *all* its children were added to an array for\nthe second time. Exactly how much storage was violated\ndepended on the number of children that zeroed process\nhad spawned (hinted at via either SIGSEGV or SIGABRT).\n\nThe earlier commit limited nested levels to 100 so the\nroot cause of the storage violation was already fixed.\nThe potential for distorted nesting levels due to sort\non start_time would seem to remain. But it's extremely\nunlikely that 2 tasks would share the same start_time.\n\nEven so, a new #define has been introduced which makes\ntop impervious to the order of tasks such that a qsort\nis no longer necessary (providing an init/systemd task\nexists & was harvested as the first task by readproc).\nIt can be utilized if distorted nesting ever becomes a\nreal issue. But since there is a 5-10% performance hit\nwith that, we'll continue using start_time as default.\n\nReferences(s):\ncommit ", "Signed-off-by: "], "commit_time": ["2014-10-28T05:00:00Z", "2014-10-29T16:00:03Z"]},

Here is a summary of the problems that\nexist with current libnuma/user possible interactions:\n\n. Whenever the numa library was present extra overhead\nwould always be incurred in maintaining the node stats\neven when the '2' or '3' commands were not being used.\n\n. As part of such overhead a separate loop was used to\nreinitialize each cpu/node structure with each display\ncycle so that prior accumulated totals were preserved.\nAgain, it didn't matter if numa data was really shown.\n\nThis commit attempts to refocus on the 'critical path'\ncosts in a running top by optimizing for the occasions\nwhen numa node data is not being displayed. Under such\nconditions, no extra overhead will be incurred whether\nor not a distribution has the libnuma library present.\n\nTo achieve this goal, some additional overhead will be\nincurred, but only when actually displaying numa data.\nAnd all such new costs have been minimized in spite of\nthe gcc inclination to duplicate subscript resolution.\n\nReference(s):\ncommit 24bd950cb2e1722d459461f0f9c0c30a4b9ffdaa\nSigned-off-by: "], "commit_time": ["2013-11-08T06:00:00Z", "2013-11-25T09:57:32Z"]},

Rather,\nit was only called if top was in one of two numa views\n(the '2' or '3' toggles). That, in turn, resulted in a\nloss of any warning message at program end unless numa\nmode had been preserved in the rcfile. In other words,\nif top was started normally then a single cycle stderr\nredirect would have long passed by the time the '2' or\n'3' toggle was activated.

Except it\nextends existing 'L'/'&' (locate/locate-next) commands\nso that an out-of-view match automatically adjusts the\nhorizontal position bringing such data into view.  And\nit provides for multiple successive same line matches.\n\nAlso, the basic 'more/less' navigation keys are active\nin this new 'Inspect' window, to ease user transition.\n\nThere are no program changes required when entries are\nadded to or deleted from the rcfile.  And there are no\nknown limits to the complexity of a script, command or\npipeline, other than the unidirectional nature imposed\nby the 'popen' function call which top cannot violate.\n\nSince it's impossible to predict exactly what contents\nwill be generated, top treats all output as raw binary\ndata.  Any control characters display in '^C' notation\nwhile all other unprintable characters show as '<AB>'.\n\nThe biggest problem encountered was with the find/next\ncapability since that strstr guy was really diminished\ngiven the possibility that numerous 'strings' could be\nencountered *within* many of top's raw, binary 'rows'.\n\nOh, and another problem was in maintaining the perfect\nleft & right text justification of this commit message\nalong with all of the commit summaries.

Extra keystroke(s) would frequently\nbe required in order to properly render top's display.\n\nAfter much sleuthing we unearthed two terminfo strings\nwhich have the effect of disabling/restoring that darn\nscrollback buffer. They were well hidden under a title\nof strings 'to start/end programs using cup'. In turn,\n'cup' deals with a tty's cursor addressing capability.\n\nWe don't care what you call them or what they refer to\nso long as they get the job done. And these really do!\nBe advised, however, that there are some side effects,\nseveral of which can even be considered as beneficial:\n\n. enter_ca_mode/smcup/ti disables scrollback buffering\n( and that's good, it's what we had always hoped for )\n\n. exit_ca_mode/rmcup/te restores the scrollback buffer\n( but also restores screen contents existing pre-top )\n( which is different from former program end results )\n( where that last rendered screen was left untouched )\n\n. the above screen replacement would impact ^Z suspend\n( thus we keep the scrollback buffer disabled during )\n( the suspend/resume sequence so that the users will )\n( have a visual clue that top is suspended not ended )\n\nIf a terminal does not support these terminfo strings,\nwe will revert to top's former behavior at program end\nwhere we position the cursor at screen bottom and then\noutput a single newline character. This will prevent a\nshell prompt from embedding within top's final screen.\n\nThis commit's approach has been tested under a variety\nof emulators and window managers, many of which linked\nwith libvte and others that employed their own scheme.\nExamples are: gnome_terminal; kde konsole; lxterminal;\nterminator; terminology; urxvt; xfce4-terminal; xterm.\n\nI do now believe that the whole SIGWINCH deal is done!\n\n(everything is perfectly justified plus right margins)\n(are completely filled, but of course it must be luck)\n\nReference(s):\n", "\n", "Signed-off-by: "], "commit_time": ["2013-01-31T06:00:00Z", "2013-02-05T11:11:22Z"]},

SCHED_BATCH can only be used at static\n       priority 0.  This policy is similar to SCHED_OTHER in that it\n       schedules the process according to its dynamic priority (based on the\n       nice value).  The difference is that this policy will cause the\n       scheduler to always assume that the process is CPU-intensive.\n       Consequently, the scheduler will apply a small scheduling penalty with\n       respect to wakeup behaviour, so that this process is mildly disfavored\n       in scheduling decisions.\n\n       This policy is useful for workloads that are noninteractive, but do\n       not want to lower their nice value, and for workloads that want a\n       determin- istic scheduling policy without interactivity causing extra\n       preemptions (between the workload's tasks).\n\nReference: ", "Acked-by: ", "\nAcked-by: ", "\nSigned-off-by: "], "commit_time": ["2011-09-25T09:17:06Z", "2012-01-09T20:37:41Z"]},
